***Mathematical modeling*** is a process where mathematics is used to understand, analyze, or predict a real-world situation. This process often occurs in cycles that revisit each of the following three stages: 

1. Translate the real-world situation into a mathematical form (called a model)
2. Shape the model to answer the question at hand
3. Evaluate the model's reliability and agreement with the real-world situation

We will discuss each stage of the modeling process in the following paragraphs and explore as a concrete example the way Sir Isaac Newton applied his theory of universal gravitation to the motion of planets.

The first stage of mathematical modeling involves **translating the real-world situation into a mathematical form**; the output or result of this stage is called a ***mathematical model***. **In this book** the objective of the translation phase will almost always be to choose or construct one or more  ***function***s that represent the relationships involved in the system being studied. You will learn several strategies for turning what you know about the system into appropriate functions. And you will learn some standard ***frameworks*** for organizing your ideas to help you determine how functions will be related, for instance Newton's framework relating position, velocity, and acceleration as rates of change of one another. 

As a concrete example of this first stage, consider how Newton had to translate observations about planetary motion into a mathematical form. He was trying to make sense of the motion of planets in light of his novel theory that gravity is a universal force of attraction between *all* masses, rather than something peculiar to celestial bodies. He showed that the motions of planets, moons, and the Sun are governed by the same basic principles as an apple falling from a tree. To do this, he modeled force as a quantity that can be measured, simplified the complexity of the planets to mere masses (another measurable quantity), and supposed that position and motion were related.
<!-- [[Taken out. because it is unclear what is being said about velocity & acceleration in this context.]] ##: He assumed ***velocity***  (the rate of change of position with respect to time) and ***acceleration*** (the rate of change of velocity with respect to time). -->
His theory of the motion of planets was based on two fundamental mathematical models: First,
$$F = ma\ \ \ \text{(Newton's Second Law)}$$ which relates force, mass, and acceleration. Second, the
$$F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{d^2}\ \ \ \text{(Law of Universal Gravitation)}$$
(sometimes called the inverse square law), which relates the mass of two objects ($m_1$ and $m_2$), and the distance between them to the force of gravitation. We will get to the purpose of the $G$ in @sec-dimensions, but for the moment, understand that this process of translating observations about planetary motion into a mathematical form is characteristic of the first stage of the modeling process.

The second stage of modeling involves doing mathematical work to **shape the model into a form that can directly answer the modeler's question of interest**. For instance, Newton knew from previous astronomical observations and Kepler's theorizing that planets' orbits are elliptical in shape that he needed to do some work on his two models to deduce the orbital shapes consistent with his Second Law and Universal Gravitation.

**In this book** you will learn to use several key tools for doing mathematical work on functions. We might as well name them now: ***differentiation***, ***anti-differentiation***, ***optimization***, and ***zero-finding***. These tools derive directly from Newton's work on planetary motion, but thankfully, we are not constrained to using the technology of his day in their application. Instead, we will leverage modern computers to make each tool easier to use. Your job is to learn enough about them that you will know when, how, and why to use each tool.

The third and final stage of mathematical modeling often involves **evaluating the model**. The goal is to determine how reliable is the model's answer and to see if the consequences of the model are consistent with what happens in the real world. The evaluation often leads to a re-assessment of the model and a return to stage 1 to improve things. The resulting loop is called the ***modeling cycle***. For example, it seems likely that Newton did not start knowing that gravitation follows an inverse square law. Perhaps he went through several ***modeling cycles*** until he found the form that was consistent with Kepler's elliptical orbits.

**In this book** you will learn techniques for comparing models to data and for making predictions from models that can be compared to observations. You will also see examples of when the evaluation of a function suggests revisions that might improve the model.
