Consider this infographic about the planets displaying solar irradiation ($SI$) versus distance from the Sun ($D$). (Hint: pay careful attention to the axes.)

```{r bssc-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="Which of the following is the most appropriate form for modeling the relationship?",
  "$SI\\equiv mD+b$",
  "$\\ln (SI\\equiv  mD+b$",
  "$SI \\equiv  m\\ln (D)+b$",
  "+$\\ln (SI)\\equiv  m\\ln (D)+b$+"
)
```
