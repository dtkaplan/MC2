Each of the curves in the graph is an exponential function $e^{kt}$, for various values of $k$.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: figflipping-2-1
slice_plot(exp(-x) ~ x, domain(x=c(-2, 2))) %>%
  slice_plot(exp(x/2) ~ x, color="orange3") %>%
  slice_plot(exp(x/1.5) ~ x, color="green") %>%
  slice_plot(exp(-x/1.5) ~ x, color="orange") %>%
  slice_plot(exp(x) ~ x, color="dodgerblue") 
```


```{r flipping-2a, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the order from $k$ smallest (most negative) to k largest?",
  "+black, orange, red, green, blue+" = "Exponential functions that grow slowly have $k$ with a small absolute value",
  "black, orange, blue, green, red" = "Sorry. Notice the red curve grows the most slowly. This means it has the smallest $|k|$.",
  "red, green, blue, orange, black" = "The orange and black curves have negative $k$, so they will be smaller than the other curves with positive sign."
)
```
