Many printed tables are meant to be used as functions; you plug in  the input values and read off the output. Here's a table  published by the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration for  the [heat index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index
), a way of summarizing the perceived comfort (or discomfort) of summer-like weather conditions.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| out-width: "90%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("Exercises/www/heat-index.png")
```


```{r daily-digital-01-QA2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What are the inputs to the heat-index function",
    "+temperature and relative humidity+",
    "temperature and wind speed" = "Those are the inputs to the wind-chill function, not the heat index.",
    "temperature, latitude, and longitude" = "The heat index does not depend on location."
)
```

The table  shows three different functions:

1. The heat index in $^\circ$ F.
2. The heat index in $^\circ$ C.
3. A caution warning level.

```{r daily-digital-01-QA3, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "For inputs of 70% relative humidity and $88^{\\circ}$ F, what are the outputs of the three functions?",
    "+$100^{\\circ}$ F, $38^\\circ$ C, and \"extreme caution\".+" = "",
    "$100^\\circ$ F, $38^\\circ$ C, and \"danger\"." = "Check again!",
    "$100^\\circ$ F, $33^\\circ$ C, and \"extreme caution\"." = "33C does is not the same temperature as 100F."
)
```


```{r daily-digital-01-QA4, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "Holding the relative humidity at 70%, how much would the ambient temperature have to increase (from $88^\\circ$ F) to change the caution-level output to \"dangerous\"?",
    "+Increase by $2^\\circ$ F+" = "",
    "Increase by  $6^\\circ$ F" = "It looks like you're increasing the humidity to the point where the heat index is $106^circ$ F. But we  asked you how much the temperature *input* has to change, not the heat-index output.",
    "Increase relative humidity to 80%." = "It is true that at $100^\\circ$ F and 80% humidity, the caution-index is \"dangerous\". But the problem specified holding humidity constant."
)
```


```{r daily-digital-01-QA5, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "From a starting point of $88^\\circ$ F and 70% humidity, what is the slope of the increase in heat index when moving to 80% humidity.",
    "+$6^\\circ$ F per 10 percentage points humidity+" = "",
    "$6^\\circ$ F" = "A slope is always \"rise over run\". You've got the rise right, but what about the run?",
    "$6^\\circ$ F per 80% humidity." = "The slope is the change in output divided by the change in input, i.e. \"rise over run\". 80% is the humidity at the endpoint, but the run is the change in humidity from the starting point to the endpoint."
)
```

```{r daily-digital-01-QA6, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What is the heat-index output when the inputs are 52% relative humidity and $91^\\circ$ F? Choose the best answer.",
  "+$98.4^\\circ$ F+" = "Of course, the 4 in the last digit is sketchy, but it is reasonable to calculate the interpolated output by averaging over neighboring outputs.",
    "$101^\\circ$ F" = "That's  the output at 55% humidity and $92^\\circ$ F.",
    "The table does not say." = "While it is true that there is no table entry specifically for 52% and $91^\\circ$ F, you can make a very reasonable guess by  *interpolation*, that is, reading between the rows and columns."
)
```

```{r daily-digital-01-TF1, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "True or false: The caution-level output could have been presented as a function of just one input, rather than needing both temperature and humidity.",
  "+TRUE+" = "The caution-level output is not a function of ambient temperature alone or of humidity alone. But if you know the heat-index, you know that caution level exactly.",
  "FALSE" = "Notice that the caution-level output is the same for any given level of the heat index, regardless of the ambient temperature or humidity separately."
)
```
