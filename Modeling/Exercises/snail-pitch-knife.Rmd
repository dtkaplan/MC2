Consider the function $h(x)$ graphed below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
f1 <- doodle_fun(~ x, seed=3233)
f2 <- doodle_fun(~ x, seed=853)
slice_plot(f1(x)*f2(x) ~ x, bounds(x=-4:4)) %>%
  gf_labs(y="h(x)")
```

For each of the values $b$ listed below, use graphical zero finding to identify one or more $x_0$ that will satisfy $h(x) = b$. If there are no such $x_0$ in the domain interval used in the graph, say so. (Your answer need only be precise to $\pm 0.1$.)

i. $b=100$
ii. $b=300$
iii. $b=500$
iv. $b= -100$
