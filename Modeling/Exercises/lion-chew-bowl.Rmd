The table shows eight of the pattern-book function shapes. 


identity | square | recip | gaussian

**sigmoid** | **sinusoid** | **exp** | **ln**



1. Identify which of the eight shapes will remain unaltered even when flipped left-to-right. <!-- square, gaussian, sinusoid -->

2. Identify which of the eight shapes will remain unaltered if flipped  left-to-right followed by a top-to-bottom flip. <!-- identity, recip, sinusoid, sigmoid -->

3. Identify which of the eight shapes will give the same result when flipped left-to-right or top-to-bottom (but not both!). <!-- identity, resid, sigmoid, sinusoid -->

4. Compare the left-to-right then top-to-bottom flipped exponential to the logarithm function. Is the doubly flipped exponential equivalent to the logarithm? Explain your reasoning. <!--No, they are different shapes. The logarithm has a vertical asymptote at input 0, whereas the exponential has no vertical asymptote.-->
