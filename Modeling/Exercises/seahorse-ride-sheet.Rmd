Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. (Here is a [2:00 min Video: Inside a Microchip, YouTube](https://youtu.be/voRQSDyPIaM).)

The graphic shows the number of transistors on various microchips dating back to 1970. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/Moore_s_Law_Transistor_Count_1970-2020.png"))
```

```{r srsm-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="What sort of frame is the data being plotted in?",
  "linear", "log-log", "+semi-log+"="The horizontal axis is linear, the vertical axis is logarithmic.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE)
```


```{r srsm-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="How many decades are shown on the vertical axis?",
  2.5, 4.3, "+7.7+"="The vertical scale runs from 1000 to 50,000,000,000, a factor of 50,000,000. `log10(50000000)` is 7.7.", 9.1,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)

```

```{r srsm-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="Seeing the data as roughly a straight line in the graphics frame, what sort of function is appropriate to model the number of chips versus year?",
  "linear", "+exponential+", "power-law",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

Roughly speaking, there were about 5000 transistors per chip in 1970 compared to about 10,000,000,000 in 2020. 

```{r srsm-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="How many doublings are involved in going from 5000 to 10,000,000,000 transistors. (Hint: `log2()` is an appropriate function to use in the calculation.)",
  16.8, "+20.9+" = "An easy calculation is `log2(10000000000/5000)`", 26.2, 31.5, 
  random_answer_order = FALSE)
```
  
```{r srsm-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="How many years per doubling in going from 5000 to 10,000,000,000 transistors over the 50 years from 1970 to 2020?",
  "1.7", "2.0", "+2.4+", "2.7",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
