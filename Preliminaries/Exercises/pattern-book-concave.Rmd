We're going to look at the pattern-book functions in terms of three properties

1. ***Slope***: whether the graph has a slope that is consistently positive, negative, both, or neither, and 
2. ***Concavity***: whether the function being graphed is concave up, concave down, neither, or both (i.e., concave up in some regions of the domain and down for others).
3. **Horizontal asymptote**: whether the function becomes approximately constant as the input goes to either plus or negative infinity.

As a reminder, here's a command to plot a function over the graphics domain $-3 \leq x \leq 3$:

```{r results="hide"}
slice_plot(exp(x) ~ x, domain(x=-3:3))
```

Fill in the following table based on the graphs you make of the pattern-book functions. We have already shown answers for the exponential and sinusoid

function name | R formula  | slope         | concavity    | horiz. asymptote
--------------|--------|---------|-------|--------
exponential   | `exp(x)`   | positive      | concave up   | $x \rightarrow -\infty$
logarithm     |
sinusoid      | `sin(x)`   | both          | both         | neither
square        |
proportional  |
constant      |
reciprocal    |
gaussian      |
sigmoid       |
