```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- doodle_fun(~ x & y, seed=8672)
```

The interactive figure displays a function, but we haven't shown you any formula for the function, just the graph.

```{r echo=FALSE,  eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
surface_plot(f(x,y) ~ x & y, bounds(x=-3:3, y=-3:3))
```

`r ifelse(!knitr::is_html_output(), "No view available in PDF format.", "")`

As you place the cursor on a point on the surface, a box will display the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates are displayed.

1. Find three points on the surface where $f(x, y)=15$. (It does not have to be exactly 15, just close.)

2. Find a point where $f(x=2, y) = 12$. 

3. Explain why you can find multiple input points that generate an output of 15, but only one point where $f(x=2, y)=12)$.
