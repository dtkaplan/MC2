Consider this expression in math notation:

<div style="font-size: 20px; text-align:center;">
$$\frac{e^{k t}}{k}$$
</div>

```{r M2R-01, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt = "Which of the following R expressions implements the math-notation expression?",
  "`k exp(kt)`" = "You must always express multiplication explicitly, using `*` between the quantities to be multiplied.",
  "`e^k*t / k`" =  "Use `exp(x)` for $e^x$.",
  "`exp(k t) / k`" = "`k t` should be written `k*t`",
  "`exp(k*t) / k`",
  "`1/k e^kt`" = "1) Use `*` for multiplication. 2) Use `exp(x)` for $e^x$.",
  right_one = "`exp(k*t) / k`"
)
```
