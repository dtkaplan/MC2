The following traditional-style notation is intended to define a function that is 2 times the pattern-book sinusoid. But something is wrong.

$$g(t) \equiv 2 \sin(x)$$

```{r OCSP2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What's wrong with the definition?",
  "$g()$ isn't an appropriate name" = "You can name functions what you like.",
  "The formula should be written $2 \\times \\sin(x)$" = "You are welcome to write things that way if you want to emphasize the multiplication, but you don't have to. On the other hand, in R it would be absolutely required to write the multiplication operator: `2 * sin(x)`.",
  "$t$ is not a good choice for the input name." = "it is a fine choice, especially when the input is time.",
  "+The input name in the formula does not match the input name on the left side of $\\equiv$.+" = "that is  it. Once you choose an input name (here, $t$), make sure to write the formula in terms of that name."
)
```
