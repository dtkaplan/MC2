When your R command is not a complete sentence, the `r sandbox_link()` will display an error like this:

$$\color{red}{\mathtt{Error\  in\ parse(text = x, keep.source = TRUE) : <text>:5:0:\\ unexpected\  end\  of\ input}}$$


The "unexpected end of input" is the computer's way of saying, "You haven't finished your sentence so I don't know what to do."

Each of these R expressions is incomplete. Your job, which you should do in a sandbox, is to turn each into a complete expression. Sometimes you'll have to be creative, since when a sentence is incomplete you, like the computer, don't really know what it means to say! But each of these erroneous expressions can be fixed by **adding** or **changing** text.

Open a sandbox and copy each of the items below, one at a time, into a sandbox. Press "Run code" for that item and verify that you get an error message. 

For the first item, the sandbox will look like this:

NEED TO SORT OUT IMAGE INCLUSION
```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-sandbox-error-2
#| fig-cap: "Running an invalid command will produce an error message."
# knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/sandbox-error.png"))
```

Then, fix the command so you get a numerical result rather than the error message.

Working through all of these will help you develop an eye and finger-memory for R commands.

i.  `sin 3`
iv. `((16 - 4) + (14 + 2) / sqrt(7)`
v. `pnorm(3; mean=2, sd=4)`
vi. `log[7]`
vii. `14(3 + 7)`
viii. `e^2`
ix. `3 + 4 x + 2 x^2`
