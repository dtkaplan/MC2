Calculus is about change, and change is about relationships. Consider the complex and intricate network of relationships that determine climate: a changing climate implies that there is a relationship between, say, global average temperature and time. Scientists know temperature changes with levels of CO~2~ and methane which themselves change due to their production or elimination by atmospheric and geological processes. A change in one component of climate (e.g., ocean acidification or pH level) provokes change in others. 

In order to describe and use the relationships we find in the natural or designed world, we build mathematical representations of them. We call these ***mathematical models***. On its own, the word "model" signifies a representation of something in a format serves a specific ***purpose***. A blueprint describing the design of a building is an everyday example of a model. The blueprint *represents* the building but in a way that is utterly different from the building itself. Blueprints are much easier to construct or modify than buildings, they can be carried and shared easily. Two of the purposes of a blueprint is to aid in the design of buildings and to communicate that design to the people securing the necessary materials and putting them together into the building itself. 

Atmospheric scientists build models of climate whose purpose is to explore scenarios for the future emission of greenhouse gasses. The model serves as a stand-in for the Earth, enabling predictions in a few hours of decades of future change in the climate. This is essential for the development of policies to stabilize the climate.

Designing a building or modeling the climate requires expertise and skill in a number of areas. Nonetheless, constructing a model is *relatively easy* compared to the alternative. Models also make it relatively easy to extract the information that's needed for the purpose at hand. For instance, a blueprint gives a comprehensive overview of a building in a way that's hard to duplicate just by walking around an actual building. 

A ***mathematical model*** is a model made out of mathematical and computational stuff. Example: a bank's account books are a model made mostly out of numbers. But in technical areas---science and engineering are obvious examples, but there are many other fields, too---numbers don't get you very far.  By learning calculus, you gain access to important mathematical and computational concepts and tools for building models and extracting information from them.






A major use for mathematics is building models, representation for a purpose, constructed out of mathematical things some of which we describe in the next section.

Models are easy to manipulate compared to reality, easy to implement (think "draw a blueprint" versus "construct a building"), and easy to extract information from. We can build multiple models and compare and contrast them to gain insight to the real-world situation behind the models.

This book presents calculus in terms of two simple concepts central to the study of change: ***quantities*** and ***functions***. Those words have everyday meanings which are, happily, close to the specific mathematical concepts that we will be using over and over again. Close ... but not identical. So, pay careful attention to the brief descriptions that follow.

## Quantity vs number 

A mathematical ***quantity*** is an amount. How we measure amounts depends on the kind of stuff we are measuring. The real-world stuff might be mass or time or length. It equally well can be velocity or volume or momentum or corn yield per acre. We live in a world of such stuff, some of which is tangible (e.g., corn, mass, force) and some of which is harder to get your hands on and your minds around (acceleration, crop yield, fuel economy). An important use of calculus is helping us conceptualize the abstract kinds of stuff as mathematical compositions of simpler stuff. For example, crop yield incorporates mass with length and time. Later, you'll see us using the more scientific-sounding term ***dimension*** instead of "stuff." In fact, Chapter \@ref(dimensions) is entirely dedicated to the topic of dimensions, but for now it's sufficient for you to understand that numbers alone are not quantities.

Most people are inclined to think "quantity" is the same as "number"; they conflate the two. This is understandable but misguided. By itself a number is meaningless. What meaning does the number 5 have without more context? Quantity, on the other hand, combines a number with the appropriate context to describe some amount of stuff. 

The first thing you need to know about any quantity is the kind of stuff it describes. A "mile" is a kind of stuff: length. A meter is the same kind of stuff: length. A liter is a different kind of stuff: volume. A gallon and an acre-foot are the same kind of stuff: volume. But an inch (length) is not the same kind of stuff as an hour (time).

"Stuff," as we mean it here, is what we measure. As you know, we measure with ***units***. Which units are appropriate depends on the kind of stuff. Meters, miles, microns are all appropriate units of length, even though the actual lengths of these units differ markedly. (A mile is roughly 1.6 million millimeters.) 

Only after you know the dimension and units does the number have meaning. Thus, a *number* is only part of specifying a *quantity*.

Here's the salient difference between number and quantity when it comes to calculus: All sorts of arithmetic and other mathematical operations can be performed to combine numbers: addition, multiplication, square roots, etc. When performing mathematics on quantities, only multiplication and division are universally allowed. For addition and subtraction, square roots, and such, the operation makes sense only if the dimensions are suitable.

The mathematics of units and dimension are to the technical world what common sense is in our everyday world. For instance (and this may not make sense at this point), if people tell me they are taking the square root of 10 liters, I know immediately that either they are just mistaken or that they haven't told me essential elements of the situation. It's just as if someone said, "I swam across the tennis court." You know that person either used the wrong verb---walk or run would work---or that it wasn't a tennis court, or that something important was unstated, perhaps, "During the flood, I swam across the tennis court."


## Functions

***Functions***, in their mathematical and computing sense, are central to calculus. At the start of the chapter, it says, "Calculus is about change, and change is about relationships." The idea of a mathematical function gives a definite perspective on this. The relationship represented by a function is between the function's input and the function's output. The input might be day of the year (1-365, often called the "Julian Date"), and the output cumulative rainfall up to that day. Every day it rains, the cumulative rainfall increases. Another relationship another function: the input might be the altitude on your hike up [Pikes Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikes_Peak) and the output the air temperature. Typically, as you gain altitude the temperature goes down. With still another function, the input might be the number of hours after noon, the output the brightness of sunlight. As the sun goes down, the light grows dimmer, but only to a point. 

A function is a mathematical concept for taking one or more ***inputs*** and returning an ***output***. In calculus, we'll deal mainly with functions that take one or more quantities as inputs and return another quantity as output. But sometimes we'll work with functions that take functions as input and return a quantity as output. And there will even be functions that take a function as an input and return a function as output.

You've almost certainly seen functions expressed in the mathematical form $f(x)$. The function is $f()$, but what is $x$? In high-school you likely learned to call $x$ a "variable." This is standard in mathematics education but it is also the source of considerable confusion. To avoid that confusion, we are going to be more precise about what $x$ means. Try to put the word "variable" out of mind for the present, until we get to discussing the nature of data.

We will make extensive use of the term ***input***. So far as $f(x)$ is concerned, we will say that $x$ is the ***name of an input***. $f(x)$ has only one input but soon we will work with functions that have multiple inputs. 

The name $x$ refers to something: the set of legitimate inputs to $f()$. For example, a function like $\sin()$ only accepts pure numbers as its input; quantities such as "3 meters" are not legitimate inputs because they have units and dimension. The word ***domain*** is a more concise way of saying "the set of legitimate inputs," as in "the domain of $\sin()$ is the set of real numbers." (***Real numbers*** is just a mathematical way of saying the values represented by the number line.)

Another important concept is ***applying a function*** to an input to produce an ***output***. For example, when we write $\sin(7.3)$ we give the numerical value $7.3$ to the sine function. The sine function then does its calculation and returns the value `r sin(7.3)`. We generally prefer to write $\sin(7.3)$ rather than `r sin(7.3)` for reasons of communication. When a person sees $\sin(7.3)$ he or she is reminded of the motivation the modeler had in mind for specifying that particular value.

Other ways that we'll signal that we are applying a function to an input is by writing something like $\sin(x=7.3)$ or, later in the book, $\left.\sin(x)\Large\strut\right|_{x=7.3}$.

Just as a "domain" is the set of legitimate inputs to a function, the function's ***range*** is the set of values that the function can produce as output. For instance, the range of $\sin()$ is the numbers between $-1$ and $1$ which we'll usually write in this format: $-1 \leq x \leq 1$.

::: {.takenote data-latex=""}
In high-school, you may have seen an expression like $m x + b$. If so, you learned to call it "a line" or perhaps even "a function." The proper term for it is a ***formula***. Formulas are one way of describing how to do a calculation.

You may also have seen an expression like $y = m x + b$. This is, of course, an ***equation***, but equations are massively overused in mathematics education. An equation like this is typically used to signify that "$y$ is a function of $x$," but we are going to be diligent in making explicit when we are defining a function. We will write $$f(x) \equiv m x + b$$ to mean "we define a function named $f()$ that takes an input named $x$." The formula on the right side of $\equiv$ tells how $f()$ calculates the value of the output for any given input.

What's wrong with writing an equation like $y = m x + b$ to define a function? The nature of equations is that they can be re-arranged. For example $$y = m x + b \ \ \text{might be re-arranged as}\ \ \ m = \frac{y-b}{x}\ .$$ Two different equations expressing the same relationship. But as definitions of functions the two equivalent equations mean might mean two different things: $y()$ takes $x$ as an input or, quite differently, $m()$ takes both $x$ and $y$ as inputs. Much better, for all concerned, to define a function
$$\text{line}(x) = m x + b$$ which has a name ($\text{line}()$) for the function and a name $x$ for the input. It also suggests that $m$ and $b$ are not inputs. You may already know that quantities like $m$ and $b$, if not explicitly given as inputs, are called ***parameters***. 

Another problem with $y = mx + b$ is that in almost all computer languages it means something completely different than than the definition of a function. Since you will be working with computers extensively in your career, we want to have a mathematical notation that is compatible with computer notation.

You will need to get used to this idea of defining a function and naming the inputs explicitly, but it will make your study of calculus much more useful.
:::

The engineers and mathematicians who invented computer languages realized  that they had to be explicit in identifying the input, the output, and the function itself; computers demand unambiguous instructions.^[Actually, it's common to give computers ambiguous instructions. The computer will carry out the instruction in the way it does, which may not be anything like what the programmer expected or intended.] Sorting this out was a difficult process even for those mathematically talented and skilled pioneers of notation. So, you can be forgiven for the occasional confusion you have when dealing with notation that pre-dates computing. 

In this book we'll be explicit and consistent in the ways we denote functions so that you can always figure out what are the inputs and how they are being translated into the output. A good start in learning to read the function notation is to see the equivalent of $y=m x + b$ in that notation: $$g(x) \equiv m x + b$$

The various mathematical functions that we will be studying in this book are in the service of practical problems. But there are so many such problems, often involving specialized knowledge of a domain or science, engineering, economics, and so on, that a abstract mathematical presentation can seem detached from reality. 

The video linked here, *How to shoot*, breaks down a simple-sounding situation into its component parts. The function itself is literally a black box. The inputs are provided by a human gunner training a telescope on a target and setting control dials. The ultimate output is the deflection of the guns in a remote turret. The main function is composed of several others, such as a function that outputs target range given the target size based on knowledge of the size of the target and how large it appears in the telescopic sight.

Dividing the gunnery task into a set of inputs and a computed output allows for  a division of labor. The gunner can provide the skills properly trained humans are good at, such as tracking a target visually. The computer provides the capabilities---mathematical calculation---to which electronics are well suited. Combining the inputs with the calculation provides an effective solution to a practical problem.

## Spaces and change

The specialty of calculus is describing relationships between ***continuous sets***. Functions such as $\sin()$ or $\text{line}()$, which are typical of the functions we study in calculus, take numbers as input.  A child learning about numbers starts with the "counting numbers":  $1, 2, 3, \ldots$. In primary school, the set of numbers is extended to include zero and the negative numbers: $-1,-2,-3, \ldots$, giving a set called the ***integers***. 

To almost everyone, its self-evident that the integers have an order and that the difference between successive integers is 1.

After this kids learn about "rational numbers," that is, numbers that are written as a ratio: $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \ldots, \frac{22}{7}$, and so on. Rational numbers fit in the spaces between the integers.

If you didn't stumble on the word "spaces" in the previous sentence, you are well on your way to understanding what is meant by "continuous." For instance, between any two rational numbers there is another rational number. Think of the rational numbers as stepping stones that provide a path from any number to any other number.

Discrete and continuous paths
:::

Might a better analogy be a walkway instead of isolated stepping stones? A walkway is a structure on which you can move any amount, no matter how small, without risk of going off the structure. In contrast, a too-small move along a path of stepping stones will put you in the water.

A continuous set is like a walkway; however little you move from an element of the set you will still be on the set. The continuous set of numbers is often called the ***number line***, although a more formal name is the ***real numbers***. ("Real" is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words, but we're stuck with it.)

The underlying metaphor here is space. Between any two points in space there is another point in space. We will have occasion to work with several different spaces, for instance:

- the number line: all the real numbers
- the positive numbers: the real numbers greater than zero
- the non-negative numbers: this is the tiniest little extension of the positive numbers adding zero to the set.
- a closed interval, such as the numbers between 5 and 10, which we will write like this: $5 \leq x \leq 10$, where $x$ is a name we're giving to the set.
- the Cartesian plane: all pairs of real numbers such as $(5.62, -0.13)$. Other metaphors for this: the points on a piece of paper or a computer screen.
- three-dimensional coordinate spaces, generally written as a set of three real numbers such as $(-2.14, 6.87, 4.03)$ but really just the everyday three-dimension world that we live in. 
- higher-dimensional spaces, but we won't go there until the last parts of the book.

Your spatial intuition of lines, planes, etc. will suffice for our needs. Mathematicians as a class value precise definitions; we won't need those. Widely accepted mathematical definitions of continuous sets date from the 1800s, 150 years *after* calculus was introduced. For instance, it's been known for more than 2000 years that there are numbers---the irrational numbers---that cannot be exactly expressed as a ratio of integers. We know now that there is an irrational number between any two rational numbers; the rational numbers are indeed analogous to stepping stones. But the distinction between rational and irrational numbers will not be one we need in this book. Instead, we need merely the notation of continuous space. And, by the way, the numbers stored and used in the normal way on computers are rational.
