The ***exponential function*** has important applications throughout science, technology, and the economy. For large negative inputs, the value is very close to zero in much the same way as for the Gaussian or sigmoid functions. But the output increases faster and faster as the input gets bigger. Note that the output of the exponential function is never negative for any input.
