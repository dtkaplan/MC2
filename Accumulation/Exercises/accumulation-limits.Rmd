Consider this function, $f(t)$:

```{r warning=FALSE}
tmp <- doodle_fun(~ t, seed = 2304)
f <- makeFun( tmp( (t-5)) - 15 ~ t)
F <- antiD(f(t) ~ t)
dt <- 0.1
Slabs <- tibble::tibble(
  t = seq(0, 10, by = dt),
  tend = t + dt,
  y = f(t),
  ymid = f(t + dt/2),
  color = ifelse(y > 0, "orange", "dodgerblue")
)

  
  gf_rect(0 + ymid ~ t + tend, data = Slabs, 
          fill = ~ color, color = NA, alpha = 0.3,
          inherit=FALSE) %>%
  gf_path(y ~ t, group=NA, size=1.5) %>%
  gf_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "orange3") %>%
    gf_refine(
      scale_y_continuous(
        breaks = c(0, -10, 10, 20), 
        labels=c("0", "neg", "pos", "")),
      scale_x_continuous(breaks=0:10),
      scale_fill_identity()
    ) %>%
  gf_labs(y="f(t)", title="Black curve shows f(t)") %>%
    gf_theme(theme(legend.position = "none"))
```

Assume that the "area" of each small box on the graph is the product of 1 Watt $\times$ 1 second.

```{r alima1}
askMC(
  "What is $$\\int_1^2 f(t) dt\\ \\text{?}$$ (Choose the closest answer. The units are in Watt-seconds.)",
  -3.2, "-1.4"="Count the boxes in the interval", "0"="Count the boxes in the interval", "2.5"="Count the boxes in the interval", "3.3" = "That's  a pretty good count of boxes, but still not the right answer.", 6.1, right_one = -3.2,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```



$$\text{Let}\ \ A = \int_1^3 f(x) dx\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ B = \int_2^4 f(x) dx$$

```{r alim1}
askMC(
  "Which is bigger, A or B?",
  "A", "B", "They are the same size", right_one = "B",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

$$\text{Let}\ \ A = \int_3^1 f(t) dt\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ B = \int_4^2 f(t) dt$$

```{r alim2}

Consider the function $$g(x) \equiv \int_4^x f(t) dt$$ for the next three questions

```{r alim3}
askMC(
  "Which is bigger, $g(8)$ or $g(9)$?",
  "+$g(8)$+", "$g(9)$"="the interval from 8 to 9 decreases the total size", "They are the same size", 
  "Trick question! There can be no such function $g(x)$ since $f()$ is a function of $t$" = "Try plugging in $x=8$ on the right side of the definition and see if it makes sense."
)
```

```{r alim4}
askMC(
  "Is $g(2.5)$ positive or negative?",
  "positive" = "The function being integrated, $f(t)$, is positive over the interval $2.5 \\leq t \\leq 4$. Since the lower limit $t=4$ is larger than the upper limit $t=2.5$, the $\\int_4^{2.5} f(t)dt$ is negative.", "zero", "+negative+"
)
```

```{r alim5}
askMC(
  "At what value of $x$ is $g(x) = 0$?",
  "2"="There is still area under the curve for this interval", "3"="There is still area under the curve for this interval", "4" = "When the two limits of integration are the same, the definite integral is *always* zero.", "5"="There is still area under the curve for this interval", "6"="There is still area under the curve for this interval", "7"="There is still area under the curve for this interval", "8"="There is still area under the curve for this interval", right_one = 4,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

$$\text{Let}\ \ h(x) \equiv \int_0^x f(t) dt$$

```{r alim6}
askMC(
  "At what value of $x$ is $h(x) \\approx 0$?",
  "1"="consider when positive and negative areas are equal in magnitude.", "2"="consider when positive and negative areas are equal in magnitude.", "3"="consider when positive and negative areas are equal in magnitude.", 4, "5"="consider when positive and negative areas are equal in magnitude.", "6"="consider when positive and negative areas are equal in magnitude.", right_one = 4,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

$\partial_x h(x)$ is a function. When we write $\partial_x h(3)$ we mean to evaluate that function for an input value of $x=3$.

```{r alim7}
askMC(
  "Which is bigger, $\\partial_x h(3)$ or $\\partial_x h(4)$?",
  "$\\partial_x h(3)$"="remember $f(t) is essentially the derivative of $h(x)$ with respect to x.","+$\\partial_x h(4)$+", "Can't tell."
)
```

$$\text{Let}\ \ y(x) \equiv \int_4^x f(t) dt$$

Here are four different graphs. 

```{r fig.height=2}
slice_plot(F(x) - F(4) ~ x, bounds(x=0:10)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "(A)")
slice_plot(F(4) - F(x) ~ x, bounds(x=0:10)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "(B)")
slice_plot(F(6) - F(x) ~ x, bounds(x=0:10)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "(C)")
slice_plot(abs(F(4) - F(x)) ~ x, bounds(x=0:10)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "(D)")
```

```{r alim8}
askMC(
  "Which of the graphs shows $y(x)$?",
  "A", "B"="Should it increase or decrease after the point crosses the x-axis?", "C"="Should it increase or decrease after the point crosses the x-axis?", "D"="When should the graph equal 0?", right_one = "A",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
