The equation for a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin is $$\frac{y^2}{r^2} -\frac{x^2}{r^2} = 1$$

This can easily be translated into $y$ as a function of $x$ (and $r$): $$y(x) \equiv r \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{r^2}} = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$$ This function produces only the top half of the circle. 

To find the area of a disk of radius $r$ (yes, we remember the answer as well as you: $A_2 = \pi r^2$) we can use the slice-and-sum technique of differentials. Here, each differential will be a vertical line segment connecting the top and bottom halves of the circle. The segment at position $x$ has length $2 y(x)$. Adding up all the segments from the minute one at $x=-r$ to the longest one at $x=0$ to the minute one at $x=r$ is simple:
$$A_2 = \int_{-r}^{r} 2 y(x) dx = \int_{-r}^{r} 2 \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} dx$$

The author looked at that integral, checked whether the integrand (that is, the function inside the $\int$ sign) is a basic modeling function (no), guessed whether substitution might work (Best guess is $u = x^2/r^2$, but that gets us nowhere.), and peeked into the possibility of integration by parts (the integrand isn't a product of two functions, so that's going nowhere).

What next? The author happens to have a little book from 1899 called *A Short Table of Integrals*:

```{r echo=FALSE, out-width: "45%", fig.show="hold"}

```

Paging through this, the author came across #125, which, to him, looked a lot like the present problem, but with the symbol $a$ instead of $r$. 

With this formula from the book , the area of the disk of radius $r$ is found by evaluating the anti-derivative at the upper and lower bounds of integration:
$$x(r^2 - x^2)\left.\right|_{-r}^r + r^2 \arcsin(x/r)\left.\right|_{-r}^{+r} = 
r^2 [\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{2}] = \pi r^2$$

Onto another slicing job ... Now that we know the area of a disk of radius $r$, we can slice up the *sphere* into disks. The radius of each disk depends on the $x$ position it is located: $r(x) = r \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{r^2}}$. Plug this into the formula for the area of a disk of radius $r$ and sum up over all the disks:
$$A_3 = \int_{-r}^{r} \pi \left[r \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{r^2}}\right]^2 dx =
\int_{-r}^r \pi \left[r^2 - x^2\right]dx$$
The integrand is a linear combination of a constant function and $x^2$. These are basic modeling function so we can find the anti-derivative easily:
$$A_3 = \pi r^2 x\left.\right|_{-r}^{+r} - \frac{\pi}{3} x^3\left.\right|_{-r}^{+r} = \\
2 \pi r^3 - \frac{2}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$

What we've seen is a process for calculating the volume $A_n$ of a disk/ball of dimension $n$. We 
1. take the formula for the volume $A_{n-1}$ of the disk/ball in a lower dimension, 
2. plug in for $r$ the function $\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$, and integrate over $x$ from $-r$ to $r$.

So, the volume of a 4-dimensional ball:
$$A_4 = \int_{-r}^r \frac{4}{3}\pi \left[\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right]^3 dx$$
We find the anti-derivative as #137 in the *Table of Integrals*

```{r echo=FALSE, out-width: "40%", fig-align: "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("IMG_3117.JPG")
```

```{r hyper1, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "Evaluate the anti-derivative #137 from $x=-r$ to $x=r. Multiply the result by $4/3$ to find the formula for $A_4(r)$. What is it?",
  "+$\\pi^2/2 r^4$",
  "$4 \pi r^4$",
  "$\\pi/2 r^4$"
)
```

Using the formula for $A_4(r)$, we can find the volume of the 5-dimensional hypersphere:

$$A_5(r) = \int_{-r}^r \frac{\pi^2}{2}\left[\sqrt{\strut r^2 - x^2}\right]^4 dx$$

This is the integral of a linear combination of power-law functions, so you can work it out using basic techniques.
