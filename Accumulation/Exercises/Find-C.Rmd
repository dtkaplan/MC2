The top graph shows a function $f(t)$. 

The bottom graph shows an anti-derivative $$F(t) \equiv \int f(t) dt$$

You can make measurements by *click/dragging* the mouse on the bottom graph.

Sometimes it is easier to think through matters when they are presented in a concrete, everyday context. Imagine that you managing a small-town water tank. Water flows in from the supply system and flows out to consumer demand. At any instant of time, there is a net amount flowing to the tank, which could be measured in cubic-meters-per-second. (If the amount is negative, consumers are momentarily consuming more than is being newly supplied.) 

The amount of water in the tank, measured in cubic meters, also fluctuates over time. We will call the water in the tank your "stock" of water. As a water manager, you want to make sure that your stock never goes to zero. (Otherwise, the town's citizens will be without water!)

Representing water by functions, the "flow" is $f(t)$. The definite integral of the flow $$\int_a^b f(t) dt$$ gives you some information about the stock: how much the amount of stock has changed from time $a$ to time $b$. This is not, however, the same as the stock. Presumably, there was already some water in the tank at time $a$, so the stock at time $b$ will be that amount plus the amount of the definite integral of $f(t)$.
