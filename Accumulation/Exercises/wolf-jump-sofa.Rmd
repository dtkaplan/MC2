Compute the value of the definite integral $$\int_0^1 x \ln(x)\, dx .$$ First, compute the anti-derivative using integration by parts, then evaluate the anti-derivative at the lower and upper bounds of integration.

As part of your work, you will need to evaluate $\left.x^2 \ln(x) {\Large\strut}\right|_{x=0}$. This is an indeterminate form, since $x=0$ is not in the domain of $\ln(x)$. So use $\lim_{x\rightarrow0} \left[{\large\strut} x^2 \ln(x)\right]$ instead Plotting out $x^2 \ln(x)$ over the domain $0 < x \leq 10^{-4}$ will guide your answer.


```{r wjso-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC("What is the value of $\\int_0^1 x \\ln(x)\\, dx$?",
      "$x^2(2\\ln(x) - 1)/4$" = "It is a definite integral, so the result should be a quantity, not a function.",
      "+-0.25+",
      "0",
      "0.25",
      random_answer_order=FALSE)
```
