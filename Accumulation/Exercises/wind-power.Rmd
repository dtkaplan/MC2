The function `windspeed(t)` records wind speed at the site of a wind-turbine farm over one day, that is, $0 \leq t \leq 24$ hours. The function `speed2power(s)` is the production function for the model of wind turbine used at the farm: the input is speed in miles per hour, the output is in kilowatts. (Both these functions were created for this exercise. They are not about a real turbine at a real wind farm, but are somewhat realistic.) Hint: you can nest a function inside of another function. For instance, if I had a function ('solarpanelpower') that calculates the amount of power a solar panel generates and another function ('sunlight') that tells me the amount of sunlight at time of the day ('TOD'). I could evaluate this in one step like the following: 'solarpanelpower(sunlight(TOD))'. This would give me the amount of power from the solar panel based upon the time of the day.

Your task, find the *total energy* generated over the 24-hour period by the turbine. Reminder: energy $E$ is electric power multiplied by time. Or, more usefully for this problem, the increment energy $dE$ generated at time $t$ is the product of power at time $t$ multiplied by the increment of time $dt$, that is, $dE = p(t) dt$. Consequently, $$E = \int_\text{morning}^\text{night} p(t) dt$$ where "morning" should really be 00:00 h and night 24:00 h on the day in question. 

We don't have an algebraic formula for `windspeed(t)` even though it is a function. You can use `antiD()` to find the anti-derivative of the electric power function. 

The answer you compute should be saved to the name `result`. The units will be in kWh -- kilowatt hours.
