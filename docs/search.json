    "text": "53.1 Origins of the gaussian function\nFrom the start of MOSAIC Calculus we have used a small set of basic modeling functions which will by now be familiar to you:\nThis chapter gives a more detailed introduction to the gaussian function and provides a specific algebraic formula that composes an exponential with a low-order polynomial.\nStart with the low-order polynomial: \\[h(x) = - \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\] This is, of course a parabola with an argmax \\(x^\\star = \\mu\\) and a maximum value 0. It is written this way by convention, the point of which is to give names to two features of the function:\n(Recall that the Greek letters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are pronounced “mu” and “sigma” respectively.)\nA reasonable person can point out that the domain of the low-order polynomial is \\(-\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty\\). It is sensible to define “width” to refer to that part of the domain where the function’s value is non-zero and, better, where “most” of the function is. One way to define “how much” of the function there is uses the area under the curve. The convention that you are about to see defines the width as the domain that contains the central 2/3 of the overall area.\nThe sandbox defines the function \\(h(x)\\) and graphs it, with particular emphasis on the range (vertical scale!) from -1 to 0. The graph is annotated with blue and red horizontal lines with y-intercept of 0 and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) respectively.\nsigma &lt;- 1\nmu &lt;- 0\nh &lt;- makeFun(  -(x-mu)^2/(2*sigma^2) ~ x, mu=mu, sigma=sigma)\nslice_plot(h(x) ~ x, bounds(x=sigma*c(-1.5, 1.5))) %&gt;%\n  gf_hline(yintercept = c(0,-0.5), color=c(\"dodgerblue\", \"orange3\"))\nThe width of the parabola is based on the length of the horizontal line segment between the two branches of the parabola. Specifically, the width is defined as half the length of this line segment. to avoid confusion, we will use “width” in the usual English sense and a special term, standard deviation, to refer to half the length of the line segment. (“Standard deviation” is a good candidate for the worst name ever for a simple concept: a length. Another, equivalent term you will hear for this length is “root mean square,” which is almost as bad. Still, those are the standard terms and you should be careful to use instead of non-standard alternatives.)\n**Part A**  In the above sandbox, set `sigma &lt;- 2`. What *standard deviation* corresponds to $\\sigma = 2$? \n1/4 1 \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) 2 4\n**Part B**  Still holding $\\sigma = 2$, what is the *variance* of the function? \n1/4 1 \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) 2 4\n**Part C**  Set $\\sigma = 3$, and read off the graph what is the *standard deviation* of the function? \n1/3 1 \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) 3 9\n**Part D**  When $\\sigma = 3$, what is the *variance* parameter? \n1/3 1 \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) 3 9\n**Part E**  Pick a $\\sigma$ of your choice, try a few non-zero values for $\\mu$. Read off from the graph the standard deviation. How does the standard deviation depend on $\\mu$? \n\nThe standard deviation is \\(\\mu + \\sigma\\).\nThe standard deviation is \\(\\sqrt{\\strut\\mu + \\sigma^2}\\).\nThe standard deviation is \\(\\ln(\\mu + e^\\sigma)\\).\nThe standard deviation is not affected by \\(\\mu\\).\n**Part F**  What is the relationship between the *variance* $\\sigma^2$ and the *standard deviation* $\\sigma$?  \n\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nThe standard deviation is 1 over the variance.\nThey are completely unconnected concepts.\nThe variance is the square of the mean, \\(\\mu\\).\nOne of the features that make bump functions useful is that they are local, the function is practically zero except on a domain of limited width. The parabola \\(h(x) \\equiv - \\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\) is non-zero everywhere except at \\(x = \\mu\\), so not at all local.\nTo produce our pattern-book bump function, we compose an exponential function \\(e^x\\) with the polynomial \\(h(x)\\) to get \\[f(x) \\equiv e^{h(x)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right)\\] This is not yet the “official” gaussian function, but are getting close!\nThe sandbox defines \\(f(x)\\) and graphs it. As with the previous sandbox, the graph is annotated with a blue horizontal line that touches the curve at the argmax and a red horizontal line with a y-intercept at \\(e^{-1/2}\\).\nsigma &lt;- 1\nmu &lt;- 0\nf &lt;- makeFun(  exp( -(x-mu)^2/(2*sigma^2) ) ~ x, mu=mu, sigma=sigma)\nslice_plot(f(x) ~ x, bounds(x=sigma*c(-3.5, 3.5))) %&gt;%\n  gf_hline(yintercept = c(0,exp(-0.5)), color=c(\"dodgerblue\", \"orange3\"))\nsigmoid &lt;- antiD(g(x) ~ x, lower.bound = -Inf)\n# Graph the sigmoid on the domain -10 &lt; x &lt; 10\nNotice that the vertical range of the function is \\(0 &lt;  f(x) \\leq 1\\). The argmax is \\(\\mu\\), so \\(f(\\mu) = 1\\). This seems easy and convenient, but one of the purposes of the standard gaussian function is to define a standard sigmoid function. It is the sigmoid that we want to have a range from 0 to 1.\nHow to scale the gaussian \\(f(x)\\) to produce a sigmoid with the range 0 to 1? Recall that a sigmoid is the anti-derivative of the corresponding gaussian. In the sandbox, we use antiD() to compute \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^x f(u) du\\], which we called sigmoid(). From the graph of sigmoid() you can read off the scaling factor that will make the vertical range of the resulting sigmoid zero to one.\n**Part G**  Where did the variable $u$ come from in $$\\int_{-\\infty}^x f(u) du ?$$ \n\nThe instructors made a mistake. They will try to be more careful in the future!\nYou can use any name for the variable of integration. The function \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^x f(u) du\\) will be a function of \\(u\\), not \\(x\\).\nYou can use any name for the variable of integration. The function \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^x f(u) du\\) will be a function of \\(x\\), not \\(u\\).\n\\(u\\) is the Latin equivalent of \\(\\mu\\).\n**Part H**  This question will take a bit of detective work in the sandbox. Make a table of a few combinations of different values for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. For each combination, find the maximum value of the corresponding `sigmoid()` function. Using this data, choose the correct formula for the maximum value of the sigmoid as a function of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. \n\n\\(\\sqrt{\\strut 2 \\pi \\sigma^2}\\)\n\\(\\pi \\sigma\\)\n\\(\\sqrt(\\strut \\mu \\pi \\sigma)\\)\n\\(\\sqrt(\\strut \\pi \\sigma^2 / \\mu)\\)\nPutting all this together, we arrive at our “official” standard gaussian function, called the Gaussian function:\n\\[g(x) \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\strut2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-(x-\\mu)^2 / 2 \\sigma^2}\\] The Gaussian function is important to many quantitative disciplines and has a central role in statistics. The function is named after physicist and mathematician Carl Friedrick Gauss (1777-1855). But in the social sciences, it is usually called the “normal” function; that is how common it is.\nIn R, the Gaussian function is provided as dnorm(x, mu, sigma). (The corresponding sigmoid, that is, the anti-derivative of dnorm() with respect to x is available as pnorm(x, mu, sigma).\nThe Gaussian function is so important, that it is worth pointing out some recognizable landmarks in the algebraic expression. Knowing to look for such things is one trait that defines an expert.\n**Part I**  Go back to the sandbox where we defined the function `f(x)` and graphed it. The function has a distinctive shape which is almost always described in terms of a familiar word. Which one is it? \nbreadloaf-shaped ghost-shaped bell-shaped sombrero-shaped\nOptional background. Now for a bit of irony. We’ve taken a lot of care to define a specific form of gaussian function with a formula that strikes many people as complicated. It must be that all these specifics are important, right? In reality, any function with a roughly similar shape would work in pretty much the same way. We could have defined our “official” gaussian function in any of a number of ways, some of which would be algebraically simpler. But the specific gaussian shape is a kind of fixed point in the differential equation that we will study next.",

    "text": "53.2 Net flux\nRecall Newton’s Law of Cooling, \\(\\dot{T} = - k (T - T_a)\\) Although temperature was hardly understood as a physical phenomenon in Newton’s era, with today’s sensibility you can understand that energy is flowing into or out of the object from the ambient environment. The word flux is often used in mathematics to refer to such flows.\nWe’ve studied cooling in a spatially discrete context, the cooling of a single point (e.g. “a cup of coffee”) in an environment that has only one property, the “ambient” temperature.\nLet’s switch to a spatially continuous context, a bar of iron with one end lying in a bed of hot coals and the other end in the open air, as in the picture:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 53.1: Source\n\n\n\nThe iron rod is incandescent at the right end and cooler toward the left. If the picture were a movie, you likely would be able to predict what the action will be: Heat will flow down the rod from right to left. The free end of the rod will eventually get burning hot.\nThe temperature \\(T\\) at each point \\(x\\) in the rod is a function of position. But at any given position, the temperature is a function of time \\(t\\). That is, the temperature of the rod is a function of two variables: \\(T(x,t)\\).\nIf we were thinking about the movie frame-by-frame, we might prefer to treat \\(t\\) as a discrete variable and could write \\(T(x,t)\\) as \\(T_t(x)\\). It does not really matter which, but it helps to think about \\(T()\\) as a function of \\(x\\) whose shape evolving in time.\nNow back to Newton’s Law of Cooling. The flux of heat is the difference between the object’s temperature and the ambient temperature. But in the continuous spatial system, the difference in temperature between two infinitely close neighboring points is zero. That suggests no flux. Of course, a major theme in Calculus is to provide means to discuss the rate of difference of a value at two infinitely close points: the derivative \\(\\partial_x T(x, t)\\). This derivative gives the flux of heat from right to left.\n\n## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might be tempting to translate this directly into the terms of Newton’s Law of Cooling and claim, wrongly that \\(\\partial_t T(x, t) = -k \\partial_x T(x, t)\\). Why is this wrong? In the spatially discrete setting—cup of coffee, ambient environment—there are only two spatial points of interest. But along the continuous iron rod, there are at least three points to be considered. Let’s call them \\(x_A\\), \\(x_B\\), and \\(x_C\\) as in the diagram. We are interested in \\(\\partial_t T(x_B, t)\\). This change in temperature at point B is driven by the flux from point C to point B and is proportional to \\(\\partial_x T(x_B, t)\\). But the change in temperature at point B is equally influenced by the flux from B to A. That is, the change in temperature at point B is set by the difference in flux, the flux coming from A to B and the flux going from B to C.\nIn the spatially continuous context, the net flux or difference in differences (A to B, B to C) is represented by the second derivative with respect to \\(x\\). That is, along the rod, Newton’s Law of Cooling amounts to \\[\\partial_t T(x, t) = k\\, \\partial_{xx} T(x, t)\\] This is called the heat equation and was introduced in 1807 by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1786-1830). The same equation is now also called the diffusion equation.\nSome people might be more comfortable thinking about the discrete-time dynamics of the movie, which could be written \\[T_{t+h}(x) \\approx T_t(x) + h\\,k\\, \\partial_{xx} T_t(x)\\]\nExercise: Turn away from the iron rod of the picture and imagine being presented with four new rods each of which has been heated in some way to produce a temperature profile at time 0, that is \\(T_0(x)\\) as shown in the four graphs below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Warning: All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 101 rows.\n## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n##   a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Warning: All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 101 rows.\n## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n##   a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Warning: All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 101 rows.\n## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n##   a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Warning: All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 101 rows.\n## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n##   a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 53.2\n\n\n\n\nFor the function \\(T(x, t=0)\\) shown in Graph (A), how will the temperature at \\(x=0\\) change instantaneously?

What are the units of the coefficient $k$? \n\\(K cm^{1}\\) \\(K cm^{2} s^{-1}\\) \\(cm^{2} s^{-1}\\) \\(s cm^{2}\\)\n\n\nAt the time Fourier was working, there was no molecular theory of matter and very little understanding of what the “heat substance” might consist of. Now we know that heat is the energy of molecular vibrations. This energy diffuses through the material.\nSimilarly, “diffusion” is one mode of physical motion of material, for example movement of sugar molecules within a cell. Other things can diffuse as well, for example the action of viscosity in fluids can be seen as the diffusion of momentum.\nStarting in the 20th century and in support of the developing molecular theory of gasses, mathematicians and physicists undertook to follow the trajectories of individual diffusing particles and to develop a means to describe them mathematically. This included the concept of a “random walk,” movement of a particle shifting direction and speed randomly as it collides with other moving molecules and particles in its environment.\nThe movie shows a simulation of a few particle (in yellow) undergoing a random walk. The path followed by each diffusing particle is shown in blue; the velocity of one particle is indicated with a red vector.\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0, Link\nThe idea of random walks has become especially important in economics and finance. The walking “particle” might be the price of a stock or other derivative asset. The “collisions” happen as individual trades are made in the market, each trade being influenced by some news or situation or the passing whims, fancies, or fears of investors. The work on this point of view started about 1900 by a mathematics graduate student, Louis Bachelier, who undertook to study the movements of the Bourse, the Parisian stock exchange. The 1997 Nobel Prize in economics was awarded for a “new method to determine the value of [market] derivatives.”\nFor these reasons, we will focus and the mathematics of diffusion instead of the equivalent but historically prior mathematics of heat. We will work with a function \\(C(x, t)\\) which stands for the concentration of particles in some medium such as a gas as a function of space and time. In economics, \\(x\\) will stand for the value of some asset such as an investment, and \\(C()\\) gives a probability density for each possible value of \\(x\\).\nFor the sake of visualization, suppose some odor molecules are released in at the midpoint of a pipe with absolutely still air. Over time, the molecules will diffuse throughout the along the extent of the pipe.\nIf \\(C(x, t)\\) is the concentration of odor molecules at each point \\(x\\) and time \\(t\\), then the change in concentration with time is:\n\\[\\partial_t C(x, t) = D\\, \\partial_{xx} C(x, t)\\] This is called the “Diffusion equation.” \\(D\\) is called the “diffusion coefficient” and depends on the size of the molecule and the temperature in the pipe. The “diffusion equation” is the same as the “heat equation,” with different names used for the quantities involved.\n\n\n**Part K**  Suppose the inputs to the concentration function have units centimeters (for $x$) and seconds (for $t$) and that the output is in nanograms per cubic centimeter ($ng\\ cm^{-3}$) . What are the units of the coefficient $k$? \n\\(ng cm^{-1}\\) \\(ng cm^{1} s^{-1}\\) \\(cm^{2} s^{-1}\\) \\(s cm^{1}\\)\n\n\nMany people have difficulty imagining the sorts of frequent collisions that are behind diffusion. They think, for instance, that in still air the molecules are pretty much still. This is wrong. A typical velocity of a water molecule in air at room temperature and pressure is 650 m/sec. (The speed of sound is about 350 m/sec.) But the time between molecular collisions is on the order of \\(10^{-10}s\\), so the typical distance travelled between collisions is about \\(10^{-7}m\\). For a root mean square distance of 1m, we need roughly \\(10^{14}\\) collisions, which would occur in \\(10^{4}\\) seconds (a couple of hours).",

    "section": "53.4 Dynamics of variance",
    "text": "53.4 Dynamics of variance\nIn this section, we will explore the connection between diffusion and the gaussian function. Recall that we modeled the temperature along a one-dimensional spatial domain (a “bar of iron”) as it evolves in time as a function of both position and time: \\(C(x, t)\\). The same sort of function—of position and time—can be used to describe the concentation of particles freely diffusing along a medium such as air in a pipe.\nWe constructed a differential equation to describe the dynamics of \\(C(x, t)\\) called the “heat” equation or the “diffusion” equation, depending on context. Before using that differential equation, let’s explore a little bit what we might mean about the “dynamics of a function.”\nIn studing dynamics we worked first with time taken discretely, e.g. a sequence of states \\({\\mathbf x}_0\\), \\({\\mathbf x}_1\\), \\({\\mathbf x}_2\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\({\\mathbf x}_n\\), \\(\\ldots\\). The vector \\({\\mathbf x}_n\\) is the “state” of the system at time step \\(n\\). In our work, we looked at 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional states, tracing out a trajectory from one time step to the next and the next and so on. Exactly the same ideas would apply to 3- and higher-dimensional states, say an ecosystem involving growing grass, and populations of mice, rabbits, foxes, birds, and so on.\nIn our present contexts, heat or diffusion, we are working with functions. Let’s return to the earlier metaphor of a movie of \\(C(x, t)\\) with the frames taken every \\(h\\) seconds. The movie is the sequence of frames \\(C_0(x)\\), \\(C_h(x)\\), \\(C_{2h}(x)\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(C_t(x)\\), \\(\\ldots\\).\nTo describe the dynamics—that is, the change from frame to frame in the movie—we write a finite-difference equation, generically: \\[C_{n+1}(x) = f(C_n(x))\\] In the movie of diffusion, that equation will be this:\n\\[C_{t+h}(x) = C_n(x) + h\\, \\alpha\\,  \\partial_{xx} C_n(x)\\] The term \\(\\partial_{xx} C(x)\\) tells us the net flux of heat/particles/probability into the point \\(x\\).\nIn English, this says, “The concentration at \\(x\\) in one frame of the movie is the amount that was there in the previous frame plus the net flux of heat/particles from the neighboring points.”\nNow imagine making the movie using an ultra-high-speed camera that takes a new frame every \\(h\\) microseconds. We will label the time of one frame as \\(t\\) and the time of the next frame as \\(t+h\\). The frame-to-frame change is therefore \\[C_{t+h}(x) = C_t(x) + h\\, \\alpha \\partial_{xx} C_t(x)\\] We can equally well write \\(C_t(x)\\) as \\(C(x, t)\\), our notation for functions on a continuous domain. Doing this, and re-arranging the formula, gives: \\[\\frac{C(x,t+h) - C(x,t)}{h} = \\alpha \\partial_{xx} C(x, t)\\] The left side of this equation is the differencing operator applied to \\(C(x, t)\\) (with respect to \\(t\\)). In the limit as \\(h\\rightarrow 0\\) (that is, as you turn the video frame rate faster and faster) we can replace the left side of the equation with the partial derivative \\(\\partial_t C(x,t)\\). That is the heat/diffusion equation.\nWe will find the solution \\(C(x,t)\\) to the differential equation using Euler’s method. In other words, we will make movies of the functions \\(C_t(x)\\) one frame at a time. We know the dynamics; to start we need is an initial condition, the function \\(C_0(x)\\).\n\nC_funs &lt;- list()\nflux_funs &lt;- list()\ntmp &lt;- list()\nxpts &lt;- seq(-50, 50, length=1000)\nC_funs[[1]] &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  x = xpts,\n  y = dnorm(x, 0, 1)\n)\n\nfor (k in 1:500) {\n  tmp &lt;- spliner(y ~ x, data = C_funs[[k]])\n  foo &lt;- flux_funs[[k]] &lt;- D(tmp(x) ~ x + x, .hstep=1)\n  C_funs[[k+1]] &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n    x = xpts,\n    y = tmp(x) + 0.1*foo(x)\n  )\n}\n\nImagine that we have a long, thin pipe filled with still air and we inject at position \\(x=0\\) a concentration of particles, say 1600 per cm^3. Equivalent, you could picture a freezing-cold iron bar and, at time \\(t=0\\), we place a white-hot coal on the center point, heating it to 1600 (deg C) and then removing the coal. The initial condition looks like this:\n\ntop &lt;- max(C_funs[[1]]$y)\ngf_line(y ~ x, data = C_funs[[1]] |&gt; filter(abs(x) &lt; 25)) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(y=\"Temperature (deg C)\", x=\"Position along bar\", title=\"Initial condition C(x,t=0)\") %&gt;%\n  gf_hline(yintercept = exp(-.5)*top, color=\"orange3\")\n\nThe red horizontal line is positioned to enable you to read off the standard deviation of the bell-shaped function.\nThe next frame of the movie will show \\(C_h(x)\\).

Far from the center point, the net flux is zero. In the next graphs, we will zoom in on the center of the domain, \\(-2.5 \\leq x \\leq 2.5\\).\nTo find the next Euler step, that is, the function \\(C_h(x)\\), we add the net flux (scaled by \\(h \\alpha\\)) to \\(C_0(x)\\). As usual, we take one Euler step after the other to reach whatever time \\(t\\) we want.\nHere is the solution \\(C(x, t=0.5)\\) shown with \\(C(x, t=0)\\) superimposed in blue.

Less obviously, \\(C(x, h)\\) is a tiny bit wider than \\(C(x,t=0)\\). That is, heat has spread out a bit from the center.\nHere is the function \\(C(x,t)\\) at \\(t=1, 2, 3, 4\\). You can see the function spreading out as \\(t\\) increases. We’ve zoomed in on the x-axis to where the action is.\naxis5 &lt;- function(P, xlim=5, dxlim=xlim/50) {\n  P |&gt; gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks=(-xlim):xlim, \n                               minor_breaks = seq(-xlim,xlim,by=dxlim)))\n}\ndraw_C(11, domain=5, show_sd=TRUE) |&gt; axis5()\ndraw_C(21, domain=5, show_sd=TRUE) |&gt; axis5()\ndraw_C(31, domain=5, show_sd=TRUE) |&gt; axis5()\ndraw_C(41, domain=5, show_sd=TRUE) |&gt; axis5()\n\n\n\nUse the intersection between the red horizontal line and the black curve to find the width of the black curve, that is, the standard deviation.

Describe briefly the very simple pattern that the variance of \\(C(x, t)\\) follows over time. (You don’t have to give a formula, just say what function it is.)",

At any given value of \\(t= t_1\\), the shape of \\(C(x,t=t_1)\\) tends to a smooth bell-shaped curve: the gaussian function. The width of the gaussian is a function of \\(t\\). Conventionally, the width corresponds to the variance parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\). This changes with \\(t\\) in a very simple way: \\[\\sigma(t)^2 = D t\\]\nEverything is smooth and nicely behaved. But this is an abstraction which summarizes the concentation of a theoretically infinite population of particles. Looking at the position of a single particle as a function of time gives a very different impression.

    "text": "53.6 Investment volatility\nWhen people invest money, they expect a return. Generally, the return is measured as a percentage per year. An \\(r=10\\%\\) annual return—that is pretty high these days—means that at the end of the year your investment of, say, $500 will be worth $550. And remember, saying \\(r=10\\%\\) is the same thing as saying \\(r=0.10\\).\nBanks and such do things in discrete time, e.g. crediting your savings account with interest once a month. But this is calculus, so we focus on continuous time. (And, of course, Nature does things in continuous time!)\nIf \\(S\\) is the amount of money you have invested at a return of \\(r\\), the evolution of \\(S\\) over time is given by a familiar, linear differential equation: \\[\\dot{S} =  r S\\ \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ \\  S(t) = S_0 e^{r t}\\]\nQuick review questions:\n\nWhich of those two equations is the differential equation and which is the solution?\nWhat symbol is being used to stand for the “state” of the system?\nWhat is the form of the dynamical function of state?\nIs there a fixed point? If so, is it stable?\n\nInvestments in the stock market provide two types of return. We will focus on the return that comes from the changing price of the stock, which can go up or down from day to day. The other kind of return is dividends, the typically quarterly payment made by the company to stock holders. In investments, dividends should not be ignored, but we aren’t interested in them here.\nNow imagine that you expect, for whatever reason, the stock price to go up by 2% per year (\\(r=0.02\\)) on average. Of course, the price is volatile so the 2% is by no means guaranteed. We will imagine the volatility is 25% per year.\nThis situation, which includes volatility, is modeled by a modification of differential equations called “stochastic differential equations.” (“Stochastic” comes from the Greek word for “aiming”, as in aiming an arrow at a target. You won’t necessarily hit exactly.) The math is more advanced and we will not go into details. Our point here is to warn you: Now that you are expert about (ordinary) differential equations, you need to be aware that things are somewhat different in a stochastic situation.\nTo that end, we will show you trajectories that follow the mathematics of stochastic exponential growth (with \\(r=0.2\\) per year and volatility \\(\\sigma = 0.25\\) per year). On top of that, we will show in red the trajectory from (ordinary, non-stochastic) exponential dynamics \\(\\dot{S} = r S\\). In blue, we will show the theoretical average stochastic dynamics. In all cases, we will set the initial condition to be \\(S_0 = 100\\). We will follow the trajectories for three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eye is drawn to the trajectories leading to large returns. That is misleading. Although there are a few trajectories that show a 3-year return above 50% (that is, to $150 or higher) in fact the majority of trajectories fall below that of a purely deterministic \\(r=2\\%\\) annual return exponential process. The volatility causes a decrease in the median return.\nIt is easy to understand why the stochastic shocks cause a loss in return. Consider a stock with an initial price of $100 that in two successive days goes up by 50% and down by 50%. These ups and downs should cancel out, right? that is not what happens:\n\\(\\$100 \\times 1.5 \\times 0.5 = \\$75\\)\n\nSome class notes in www/2021-03-31-classnotes.Rmd",

    "text": "41.1 Dynamical function and flow\nThe previous two chapters presented ideas relating to dynamical systems: state, state-space, dynamical function, flow, trajectory, “solution.” Now we turn to the some of the phenomena seen in dynamical systems, starting in the simplest way possible: dynamical systems with a single state variable. We will focus on fixed points and their stability, which can be understood qualitatively (although you need to distinguish between a positive and a negative slope). Then we will look at a technique we have encountered since Block 2: approximation of a function by a straight-line function. Such linear dynamics have a straightforward exponential “solution.”\nFinally, we will look at an important example of how careful observation of fixed points and the way dynamics change when we modify a parameter in the dynamical functions provides an understanding of a ecological stability and instability and the consequences that result.\nIn the previous chapter, we saw how to draw a flow field in a two-dimensional state space, evaluating the dynamical functions and using the results to construct a vector. We cannot practically visualize both the flow and the shapes of the two dynamical functions in a single plot, which makes it harder to understand structures such as fixed points.\nHappily, with a one-dimensional state space, we can easily show both the flow vectors and the single dynamical function at once.\nFor ease of reference, we will name the dynamical function for the rest of this section \\(f(x)\\), so that the differential equation is \\[\\partial_t x = f(x)\\ .\\]\nThe flow itself appears as the example in Figure 45.1. The state space is the number line and the flow vectors are, as usual arrows that point from place to place in the state space.\nBecause the state space can be drawn without using the vertical coordinate of the page, we can use that vertical coordinate to show something else: the dynamical function, as in Figure 45.2.\nThe correspondence between the dynamical function and the flow field is easy to see in such a presentation. Where the output of the dynamical is large and positive (say, near \\(x=0\\)), the flow is in the positive direction and relatively fast, as shown by a long, right-pointing flow vector. When the output of the dynamical function is negative (around \\(x=3\\), for instance) the flow is in the negative direction: a left pointing arrow.\nNear a zero crossing of the dynamical function, the flow arrows are negligibly short: the state velocity is very slow. Indeed, at the zero crossings, the state velocity is exactly zero. Such zero crossings are called fixed points: since the state velocity is zero, the state never moves!\nWe can see the dynamics near fixed points more closely by zooming in, as in Figure 45.3 which shows two of the system’s fixed points.\nNotice in Figure 45.3 that the flow is slower the nearer the state is to the fixed point, but it is only exactly zero at the fixed point.\nA calculus technique you will be familiar with from previous Blocks is zooming in a region that we want to examine in detail.\nThe short pieces of the dynamical function shown in Figure 45.4, are, like short pieces of any continuous function: almost exactly straight lines. For the left fixed point, the dynamical function is \\(f(x) \\approx -2.804 (x + 3.055)\\) while for the right it is \\(f(x) \\approx 5.065 (x + 1.586)\\). In Section @ref(symbolic-solutions-ODE) we found symbolically the solutions for dynamical functions in this form. For \\(x_0\\approx-3.055\\) the solution is \\[x(t) \\approx (x_0 + 3.055)e^{-2.804 t} - 3.055\\ ,\\] while for \\(x_0\\approx -1.586\\) the solution is \\[x(t) \\approx (x_0 +1.586)\\, e^{5.065 t} - 1.586\\ .\\] There is something fundamentally different about these two solutions. One of them is exponential decay toward the fixed point, while the other grows exponentially away from the fixed point. We call the dynamics near the fixed-point with exponential decay stable and the dynamics near fixed-point with exponential growth unstable.",

In the movie below, the state space is shown as a horizontal line, as before. The vertical axis shows the dynamical function as in Figure 45.2. The dynamical function is shown in a second way as well: the hue and intensity of color, which lets you focus on the activity in the state space. This activity is shown by the moving gray triangles. Each triangle is placed on the phase line to mark an initial condition, then moves right or left according to the dynamics.",

    "section": "45.2 Linearization",
    "text": "45.2 Linearization\nYou can see in Figure 45.6 that many of the solutions approach their final, equilibrium value in an exponential manner. This is particularly true for the solutions with initial conditions very near the stable fixed points. All these solutions are characterized quantitatively by the parameter \\(a\\) in the exponential solution \\(A e^{a t}\\). (Remember, \\(a &lt; 0\\) when there is exponential decay.)\nQuantitative knowledge of \\(a\\) is helpful to understand the time scale of the exponential approach to stable fixed points. We can find a numerical value for \\(a\\) for each fixed point by constructing a linear approximation to the dynamical function near each of the fixed points.\nThe procedure involves the same principles as introduced in Block 2 for constructing low-order polynomial approximations to functions, but here “low-order” means “first order.”\nThe analysis is done separately for each of the fixed points, so the first step is to find the fixed points, the values \\(x^\\star\\) such that \\(f(x^\\star) = 0\\).\nRecall from Block 2 the Taylor polynomial approximation to a function \\(f(x)\\) centered on a point \\(x^\\star\\): \\[f(x) \\approx f(x^\\star) + \\partial_x f(x^\\star) \\left[x - x^\\star\\right]\\] When \\(x^\\star\\) is a fixed point, \\(f(x^\\star) = 0\\) so the approximation is simply \\(f(x) \\approx \\partial_x f(x^\\star) \\left[x - x^\\star\\right]\\). Keep in mind that \\(\\partial_x f(x^\\star)\\) is the derivative function \\(\\partial_x f\\) evaluated at the input \\(x^\\star\\), so \\(\\partial_x f(x^star)\\) is simply a quantity, not a function. Indeed, \\(\\partial_x f(x^star)\\) is exactly the quantity \\(a\\) in the exponential solution \\(e^{a t}\\).\nThis process of constructing the linear approximation \\(f(x) \\approx a \\left[x - x^\\star\\right]\\) is called linearization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it! 45.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it! 45.1 Exponential dynamics near fixed points\n\n\n\nConsider the first-order differential equation \\[\\partial_t x = f(x) \\equiv r x (x - x/K)\\] where \\(r\\) and \\(K\\) are parameters that are greater than zero. Linearizing the nonlinear function \\(f(x)\\) lets us figure out how fast or slow is the exponential growth or decay of the solutions for initial conditions near the fixed points.\n\nThere are two fixed points, one at \\(x_1^\\star = 0\\) and the other at \\(x_2^\\star = K\\). What is the exponential parameter \\(a\\) for each of the fixed points.\nThe derivative (with respect to \\(x\\)) \\(\\partial_x f(x)\\) can be found with the product rule from Block 2. It is \\[\\partial_x f(x) = r\\, (1 - x/K) - r\\, x\\, (1/K)\\]\nEvaluating \\(\\partial_x f(x)\\) at the two fixed points \\(x_1^\\star = 0\\) and \\(x_2^\\star = K\\) gives\n\n\\[\\partial_x f(x_1^\\star) = r\\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\partial_x f(x_2^\\star) = -r\\] Solutions near \\(x_1^\\star\\) will grow exponentially as \\(e^{r t}\\), unstable since \\(0 &lt; r\\). Solutions near \\(x_2^\\star\\) will decay toward \\(x_2^\\star\\) in an exponential manner as \\(e^{-r t}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is critical to distinguish carefully between \\(x^\\star\\), which is the location of the fixed point being examined, and \\(x_0\\), which is the initial condition of the state, that is, \\(x(t=0)\\).\n\n\n\nApplication area 45.1  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication area 45.1 Retirement savings redux\n\n\n\nLet’s return to the model of saving for retirement in Chapter 39: \\[\\partial_t V = r\\, V + M\\ .\\] The state variable here is named \\(V\\). The dynamical function is \\[g(V) = r\\, V + M\\] where \\(r\\) is the interest rate (say, 3% per year which is \\(r=0.03\\) per year) and \\(M\\) is the monthly contribution. To keep the units consistent, we set the units of \\(t\\) to be years, of \\(r\\) to be 1/years, of \\(V\\) to be dollars and of \\(M\\) to be dollars-per-year. So a monthly contribution of \\(1000 would come to\\)M=12000$ dollars-per-year.\nFind the amount \\(V\\) that will result from 30 years of savings with an initial condition \\(V_0 = 0\\).\nStep i) Find the fixed point. This is a value \\(V^\\star\\) such that \\[r\\, V^\\star + M = 0\\ \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ \\ V^\\star = -M/r\\ .\\] Step ii) Find the derivative of the dynamical function evaluated at the fixed point: Since \\(g(V)\\) happens to be a straight-line function, we know the derivative is a constant. So \\(b = \\partial_x g(V^\\star) = r\\).\nStep iii) Translate the state variable into \\(y = V - V^\\star\\). The dynamics of \\(y\\) are \\(\\partial_t y = b y\\), which has an exponential solution \\(y = A e^{bt}\\).\nStep iv) \\(A\\) is the initial condition of \\(y\\). This will be \\(y_0 = V_0 - V^\\star\\). Since we stated that \\(V_0 = 0\\) (no savings at the start), \\(y_0 = -V^\\star\\) and the solution is \\[y(t) = -V^\\star e^{bt} = \\frac{M}{r} e^{rt}\\ .\\]\nStep v) Translate the solution in step (iv) back into terms of \\(V(t)\\). Since \\(y(t) = V(t) - V^\\star\\), this will be \\(V(t) = y(t) + V^\\star\\) or, \\[V(t) = \\frac{M}{r} e^{r t} + V^\\star = \\frac{M}{r} \\left[ e^{r t} - 1\\right]\\ .\\] To get an idea of this retirement plan, that is, \\(r=3\\%\\) and \\(M=12000\\) dollars-per-year, let’s see how much you will have after 30 years and 40 years.\n\nV &lt;- makeFun((M/r)*(exp(r*t)-1) ~ t, r=0.03, M=12000)\nV(30)\n## [1] 583841.2\nV(40)\n## [1] 928046.8\n\nAfter 40 years of contributions, your retirement account will have almost one-million dollars.\nYou could have accomplished the same calculation using integrateODE(), like this:\n\nSoln &lt;- integrateODE(dV ~ r*V + M, V=0, M=12000, r=0.03,  \n                     domain(t=0:40))\n## Solution containing functions V(t).\nSoln$V(30)\n## [1] 583841.2\nSoln$V(40)\n## [1] 928046.8",

    "section": "45.3 Bifurcation",
    "text": "45.3 Bifurcation\nA broad, pressing, social concern goes under the name sustainability. Is it sustainable to burn fossil fuels at steady historical levels, let alone at the increasing rate seen since over the last century? Climate scientists answer resoundingly with a no. Is it sustainable to increase food production to the levels needed for developing economies to approach the sort of consumption seen in rich economies?\nDynamical systems are highly relevant to the questions surrounding sustainability. If the economy is near a stable fixed point, then it is sustainable; the trajectory will bring the state of the economy toward the fixed point. On the other hand, if the economy is near an unstable fixed point, we can expect exponential change.\nIf such exponential changes are not seen, does that mean we are not near an unstable fixed point? One of the terms used to mark the possibility that a stable system can quickly turn unstable is tipping point, defined as\n\nThe point at which a series of small changes or incidents becomes significant enough to cause a larger, more important change. Source: New Oxford American Dictionary\n\nThe mathematics of tipping points is not at all the same as exponential growth. Certainly, in exponential growth one sees a relatively slow rate of change increase to a large rate of change, a situation described by journalists as “sky-rocketing” or “explosive” or, literally, “exponential.” As you’ve seen, exponential growth is a phenomenon seen in linear dynamical systems; there is no special point at which the dynamics changes.\nThere is an area of mathematical theory called catastrophe theory. We will use a famous example to show how catastrophes or tipping points are modeled mathematically.\nThe example comes from a 1977 article in Nature, one of the world’s most prestigious scientific journals. The article, by Robert May, is entitled “Thresholds and breakpoints in ecosystems with a multiplicity of stable states.” The words “thresholds” and “breakpoints” have not been encountered yet in this book, but “multiplicity of stable states” should bring to mind the sort of dynamics seen in Figure 45.2.\nThe setting for the catastrophe is an otherwise bucolic scene, livestock grazing on a pasture. A pasture is a kind of factory for producing vegetable biomass; the grazing is the consumption of the biomass produced.\nAs a model for the production of biomass, denoted \\(v\\) for “vegetation,” we will use \\[\\partial_t v = r v \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{K}\\right)\\] which, as we’ve seen, has an unstable fixed point at \\(v_1^\\star=0\\) and a stable fixed point at \\(v_2^\\star=K\\). Physically, the fixed point \\(v_1^\\star\\) corresponds to a bare field, without any vegetation. It is unstable because any small disturbance in the form of a stray seed landing in the dirt can lead to germination and the rapid growth of vegetation as seeds from the germinated plant spread across the field. Once the field is covered in vegetation, the growth can be exponentially rapid at first but then runs into limited resources: there is only so much sunlight that falls on the field, and the growing vegetation will eventually consume the soil nutrients and water.\nThis biomass production model corresponds to a sustainable system. Once the biomass level is at \\(v_2^\\star\\) it will stay there.\nBut biomass production is not the only thing going on in the pasture. The grazing animals—let’s imagine they are cows—are consuming the grass. To start very simply, suppose that each cow consumes amount \\(C\\) of biomass each day. If there are \\(H\\) cows, the total consumption is \\(H C\\) per day. This modifies the dynamics to a slightly new form \\[\\partial_t v = r \\,v(1+\\frac{v}{K}) - HC\\]. The original, ungrazed dynamics are compared with the grazed dynamics in Figure 45.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 45.7: Comparing the pasture dynamics for different herd sizes.\n\n\n\nWith grazing, the net growth of biomass is reduced due to the removal of the consumed biomass by the cows’ consumption. For a moderate herd size, there is still a stable fixed point, but it is at a lower level of biomass than would be seen in the ungrazed field. But if the herd size is too large, the ecosystem completely collapses.\nThis is an example of a tipping point or catastrophe. For moderate herd sizes, there remains a stable fixed point. A farmer might be tempted to add another cow to the pasture, and that is sustainable: there is still a stable fixed point. Indeed, the movement of the stable fixed point might not even be noticed. But add even one cow too many and the fixed point entirely disappears. Still, herd management can fix the problem; take away the cow that tipped the pasture and the fixed point will return.\n\nApplication area 45.2 —Details of chewing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication area 45.2 Cows eat grass\n\n\n\nChapter 16 illustrated the iterative process for building models: using the results of a model to suggest possible improvements in the model. Let’s look again at how cows eat grass.\nMissing from the pasture model is a simple idea of how cows eat. If there is very little biomass, the cows cannot continue to eat their fill. Will the reduction in consumption per cow preserve the stable fixed point?\nIn his Nature article, May modeled the consumption rate by a single cow with the functional form \\[C(v) \\equiv \\frac{\\beta v^2}{v_0 - v^2}\\] which is graphed for \\(\\beta=0.1\\) and \\(v_0 = 3\\) in Figure 45.8\n\n\n\n\nconsumption &lt;- makeFun((beta*v^2/(v0^2 + v^2))~ v, beta=0.1, v0=1)\nslice_plot(consumption(v) ~ v, bounds(v=0:10)) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(y=\"Consumption (tons/day)\", x=\"v: available biomass (tons)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 45.8: Consumption of vegetation by a single cow as a function of the amount available in the pasture.\n\n\n\nYou can recognize this as a form of sigmoid. When the amount of vegetation is very large, a cow will eat her fill. That is the saturation of the sigmoid. For small \\(v\\), the cow needs to hunt around for vegetation tall enough to eat, reducing the consumption steeply.\nFigure 45.9 modifies the pasture dynamics to incorporate this sigmoid model of consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 45.9: Pasture dynamics for a sigmoid consumption function.\n\n\n\nWe can start the story with 3 cows in the pasture. Vegetation growth is more than sufficient to provide for these cows. You can see this from the stable fixed point at about 9 tons of biomass, which is more than enough to reach saturation of the sigmoid consumption function.\nThe farmer decides to increase the herd to 5 cows. Nothing much happens. The stable fixed point is at about 8 tons of biomass, entirely adequate to keep the cows well fed in a sustainable manner.\nCan the pasture be sustainable with 7 cows? The stable fixed point remains, now at about 6.5 tons at biomass. The cows are still sustainably well fed.\nYou can see in the 7-cow dynamics a hint of what of what might go wrong. There is a new, unstable fixed point at about 3 tons of biomass. If the pasture ever happened transiently to fall below 3 tons—say due to a summer frost followed by a return to normal weather—the vegetation biomass will head toward the new stable fixed point at 0.5 tons of biomass. At this level, the cows are eating only about one-quarter their normal amount and we can fairly say that the ecosystem has collapsed. But until such a disaster happens, the farmer will see only a sustainable level of biomass with cows well fed.\nIt is only we, who have a mathematical model of the situation, who can anticipate the potential problems.\nSince things are fine with 7 cows in the field, the farmer lets an eighth cow join the herd. That is the tipping point. The happy herd fixed point at 6.5 tons of biomass has disappeared, and the ecosystem collapses, even without a weather disaster.\nRemoving the eighth cow from the pasture will not fix the situation. With seven or even six cows in the pasture, the system won’t be able to grow out of the stable fixed point with 0.5 tons of biomass. Reducing the herd size to five will remove that 0.5 ton fixed point, but the grass will grow back very slowly; the dynamics give positive growth, but very close to zero.\nAvoiding such catastrophes is a major motivation for mathematical modeling.",
