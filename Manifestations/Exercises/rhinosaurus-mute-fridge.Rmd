The drawing canvas has been populated with three Bézier segments. Connect and shape them to reproduce the shape of the airfoil shown below. Note that the airfoil surface smoothly rounds the leading edge but has a sharp junction at the trailing edge. Note also that the top and bottom surfaces are **not symmetric**.

```{r echo=FALSE, out-width: "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/airfoil-1.png"))
```

Your task is to reproduce the airfoil shape using Bézier segments. 

i. On your homework paper, sketch the shape you created, indicating where the control points are for each segment. 
ii. If you were able to reproduce the airfoil shape using 1 or 2 Bézier segments your answer to (i) will suffice. If you need 3 segments, briefly explain what aspects of the airfoil shape required three segments.
