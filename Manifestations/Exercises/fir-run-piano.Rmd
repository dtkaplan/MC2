Confirm the calculation of the center of mass of the panel shown in Figure \@ref(fig:panel-shape). The left edge of the panel is at -1.5 m, the right edge at 4.0 m. The functions describing the top and bottom edges of the panel are
```{r}
top <- rfun(~ x, seed=120)
bottom <- rfun(~ x, seed=2894)
```

A. Calculate the area of the panel. The coordinates have units of meters.

B. Calculate the mass of the panel. The density of the sheet aluminum is 8.1 kg/m^2^.

C. Calculate the $x$-component of the center of mass.

D. Calculate the $y$-component of the center of mass.
