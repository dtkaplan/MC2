Navigators are used to specifying a direction as a compass heading: a single number between 0 and 360. For specifying direction on a plane, this is 
YOU WERE HERE. 




ASK THEM TO FIND LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF COMPASS DIRECTIONS and translate into a heading. (or vice versa.)


```{r echo=FALSE, fig-align: "center", out-width: "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/compass.jpeg"))
```
