Here are several vectors:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="3.5in"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/many-vectors1.png"))
```

a. Remembering that mathematical vectors have only two properties---length and direction---how many different mathematical vectors are being shown.

<!-- Answer: Five. Color is not a property of a mathematical vector. Orientation, however, is. -->

b. Measure the length of each vector. (Hint: Use a ruler! You can round to the nearest millimeter.)

c. Find the included angle between the [blue]{style="color: blue;"} and $\color{brown}{\text{brown}}$ vectors. (Your answer should be correct to within $\pm 15^\circ$.)

<!-- About 135 degrees. Note that the orientation makes a difference. The angle is measured with the vectors placed tail to tail. -->

d. Find the included angle between the [magenta]{style="color: magenta;"} and [blue]{style="color: blue;"} vectors. 

<!-- Magenta points in the same direction as brown, so the answer is the same as in 
the previous question. -->

e. Find the included angle between 0.7 times the [blue]{style="color: blue;"} vector and -11.3 times the $\color{brown}{\text{brown}}$.

<!-- The scaling does not matter except that the negative sign for the brown vector means that its orientation will be reversed. This means that the included angle will be 45 degrees, not 135 degrees as in the previous two questions. -->
