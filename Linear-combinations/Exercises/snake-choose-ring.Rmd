Write (or draw) your  answers on a sheet  of  paper. You  can  do the any calculations you need in  the  sandbox. Make sure to write column vectors  in  a  correct  column  format. Use a `r sandbox_link()` for numerical calculations. 


a. What is $5.42 \left(\begin{array}{r}7.3\\8.9\\-2.4\end{array}\right)$?
b. What is $-2.67 \left(\begin{array}{r}-19.34\\0.23\\14.82\end{array}\right)$?
c. Draw  a  vector of your  own  choice. Next to  it,  draw the vector which is 2.5  times your vector.
d. Take  your  original vector from (c) and draw  the  vector which  is -3 times it. 
e. Write down the  R  code to  create a vector named `w` that is $$\left(\begin{array}{c}2\\5\\1\\5\end{array}\right)$$
