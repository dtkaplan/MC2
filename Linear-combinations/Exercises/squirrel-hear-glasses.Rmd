Copy over and label these vectors onto your paper. Any good approximation will do.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/4vectors.png")
```

Then, on  paper, draw (and label with the Roman numeral) the following vector  additions and subtractions. (You should "show your work" by  putting  the vectors being  added in  the diagram along with the result of the addition.)

i. $\vec{a} + \vec{b}$
ii.  $\vec{c}  + \vec{d}$
iii. $\vec{d}  +  \vec{b} +  \vec{a}$
iv. $\vec{b} -  \vec{a}$
