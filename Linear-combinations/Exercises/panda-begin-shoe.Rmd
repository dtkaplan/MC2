Refer to  the vectors $\vec{a}$,  $\vec{b}$,  $\vec{c}$, and  $\vec{d}$ in  the figure. Carry  out the  following  projections graphically.  You should show not only the result  of the  projection, but also the original  vector being  projected and the original vector being  projected onto.

i. Project $\vec{a}$  onto  $\vec{b}$
ii.  Project $\vec{c}$ onto $\vec{a}$
iii.  Project $\vec{b}$  onto  itself.

Go back to your diagrams and add on to  each diagram the residual vector from  the projection. Make sure to use a different color ink or some other device to  distinguish the residuals from the vectors you had already drawn.
