Here are 12 vectors, labeled "a" through "m." (Letter "i" has been left out.) There are several quick questions, each of which makes a claim about whether the sum of two vectors equals a third. Answer *true* or *false* to the claim. There are no tricks about exactitude, so if the claim is close to being true, answer true.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%",  fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/vectors-for-sums.png"))
```

#. $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{L}$
#. $\vec{b} + \vec{J} = \vec{a}$
#. $\vec{b} + \vec{m} = \vec{J}$ 
#. $\vec{c} + \vec{f} = \vec{d}$
#. $\vec{k} + \vec{L} = \vec{e}$ 
#. $\vec{e} + \vec{b} = \vec{m}$
#. $\vec{m} + \vec{g} = \vec{b}$
