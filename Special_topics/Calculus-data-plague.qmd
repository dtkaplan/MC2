The title page of John Graunt's *Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality*"
:::

Plague was the motivating factor in another important work, published in 1661, *Natural and Political Observations ... Made upon the Bills of Mortality* by [John Graunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graunt) (1620-1674). [Bills of mortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bills_of_mortality), listings of the number and causes of deaths in London, had been published intermittently starting in in the plague year of 1532, and then continuously from the onset of plague in 1603. Graunt, a haberdasher by profession, performed what we might now call ***data science***, the extraction of information from data. For instance, Graunt was the first to observe the high rate of child mortality and that the number of deaths attributed to plague was underestimated by about one quarter. Graunt's work led to his election to the Royal Society, the same august group of scientists of which Isaac Newton was a member (and later president). Graunt is considered the first demographer and epidemiologist.
