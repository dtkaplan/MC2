Newton's first Calculus book, written in 1669 but not published until 1711.

Translated from the original Latin, Newton's book title is *On Analysis by Equations with an infinite number of terms*. This title makes it seem that Calculus and "equations" are intimately connected. But in today's era of computing, an approach to calculus based on **functions** is more appropriate. Perhaps Newton would have thought so too, but the mathematical idea of functions wasn't invented until after Newton's death.

The notion of a function was introduced by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783). In some ways, his notation was close to that we are using now. For instance, on page 149 of Euler's *Introductio in analysin infinitorum** v. 1 (1748) we find $l()$ (lower-case L) being used as the name for the "hyperbolic logarithm" function: 

$$l(1-x)$$

Modern convention frowns on the use of $l()$ as a name, since it is easily confused for a 1. The names $f()$, $g()$, and $h()$ are just as compact and are more typographical distinctive.
