# Partial change and the gradient vector {#sec-partial-change}

For a function with one input, the derivative function (with respect to that input) outputs a single quantity at each input value. We have often drawn the quantity as a sloping line. This is easy to do on the two-dimensional surface of paper or a screen.

It would be silly to restrict our models to using functions of a single variable just so that we can show them on paper or a screen. For functions with multiple inputs, the output of the derivative function will not be a single quantity, but a *set of quantities*, one for each input. The derivative of a function of multiple inputs *with respect to only one of those inputs* is called a **partial derivative**. "Partial" is a reasonable word here, because each partial derivative gives only part of the information about the overall derivative with respect to *all of the inputs*. The set of all the partial derivatives, called the **gradient**, is a way of representing the "slope" of a function of multiple inputs.


## Calculus on two inputs

Although we use contour plots for good practical reasons, the ***graph*** of a function $g(x,y)$ with two inputs is a surface, as depicted in @fig-first-surface. The derivative of $g(x,y)$ should encode the information needed to approximate the surface at any input $(x,y)$. In particular, we want the derivative of $g(x,y)$ to tell us the orientation of the ***tangent plane*** to the surface.

A tangent plane is infinite in extent. Let's use the word ***facet*** to refer to a little patch of the tangent plane centered at the point of contact. Each facet is flat. (it is part of a plane!) @fig-melon-facets shows some facets tangent to a familiar curved surface. No two of the facets are oriented the same way.

A melon as a model of a curved surface such as the graph of a function of two inputs. Each tangent facet has its own orientation. (Disregard the slight curvature of the small pieces of paper. Summer humidity has interfered with my attempt to model a flat facet with a piece of Post-It paper!
:::

Better than a picture of a summer melon, pick up a hardcover book and place it on a curved surface such as a basketball. The book cover is a flat surface: a facet. The orientation of the cover will match the orientation of the surface at the point of tangency. Change the orientation of the cover and you will find that the point of tangency will change correspondingly.  

If melons and basketballs are not your style, you can play the same game on an interactive graph of a function with two inputs. The snapshot below is a link to an applet that shows the graph of a function as a **blue** surface. You can specify a point on the surface by setting the value of the (x, y) input using the sliders. Display the tangent plane (which will be **green**) at that point by check-marking the "Tangent plane" input.

For the purposes of computation by eye, a contour graph of a surface can be easier to deal with. @fig-whole-plot shows the contour graph of a smoothly varying function. Three points have been labeled A, B, and C.

Zooming in on each of the marked points presents a simpler picture for each of them, although one that is different for each point. Each zoomed-in plot contains almost parallel, almost evenly spaced contours. If the surface had been exactly planar over the entire zoomed-in domain, the contours would be *exactly* parallel and exactly evenly spaced. We can approach such exact parallelness by zooming in more closely around the labeled point.

Zooming in on the neighborhoods of points A, B, and C in @fig-whole-plot shows a simple, almost planar, local landscape. The tangent plane for each point is the linear approximation. The [brown arrows]{style="color: brown;"} are *gradient vectors*, which will be introduced in @sec-gradient-vector. 
:::

Just as the function $\line(x) \equiv a x + b$ describes a straight line, the function $\text{plane}(x, y) \equiv a + b x + c y$ describes a plane whose orientation is specified by the value of the parameters $b$ and $c$. (Parameter $a$ is about the vertical location of the plane, not its orientation.) 

The linear approximation shown in each panel of @fig-zoomed-plot has the same orientation as the actual function; the contours face in the same way. 


Remember that the point of constructing such facets is to generalize the idea of a derivative from a function of one input $f(x)$ to functions of two or more inputs such as $g(x,y)$. Just as the derivative $\partial_x f(x_0)$ reflects the ***slope*** of the *line* tangent to the graph of $f(x)$ at $x=x_0$, our plan for the "derivative" of $g(x_0,y_0)$ is to represent the ***orientation*** of the facet tangent to the graph of $g(x,y)$  at $(x=x_0, y=y_0)$. The question for us now is what information is needed to specify an orientation. 

One clue comes from the formula for a function whose graph is a plane oriented in a particular direction:

$$\text{plane}(x,y) \equiv a + b x + cy$$

## @try-plane-orientation R/mosaic: Orientation of a plane
To explore the roles of the parameters $b$ and $c$ in setting the orientation of the plane, use @lst-plane-orientation.  The R/mosaic code defines `plane()`, a function of two inputs whose surface graph is a planar facet. Then this facet is graphed as a contour plot. Change the numerical values of $b$ and $c$ and observe how the orientation of the planar surface changes in the graphs.

```
:::

By varying $a$ while holding $b$ and $c$ constant, you can that the value of $a$ is irrelevant to the orientation of the plane, just as the intercept of a straight-line graph is irrelevant to the slope of that line. @sec-gradient-vector introduces the *gradient vector*. As a preview of things to come, we've drawn the gradient vector at each of nine positions as [brown arrows]{style="color: brown;"}.

## @try-move-book Plane orientation, analog version

An instructive experience is to pick up a rigid, flat object, for instance a smartphone or hardcover book. Hold the object level with pinched fingers at the mid-point of each of the short ends, as shown in @fig-hold-book (left).  

::: {#fig-hold-book layout-ncol=3}
![(a) A level surface](www/level-book.png)

![(b) Rotated along the axis running top to bottom](www/rotated-book.png)

![(c) Rotated along the axis running left to right](www/tipped-book.png)

Two orientations for tipping a planar facet (the black pad). A dog (the paw) is supervising the activity.
:::

You can tip the object in one direction by raising or lowering one hand. (panel b) You can tip the object in the other coordinate (panel c) by rotating your thumb and forefinger while keeping hand level constant. By combining these two motions, you can orient the surface of the object in a wide range of directions.

Pilots or sailors know that the orientation of an object---a plane or a boat---is described by three parameter: pitch, roll, and yaw. What's different for a planar facet? It has no front or back end, unlike a plane or boat, so yaw doesn't apply. Only pitch and roll are needed to describe the orientation of the facet.
:::

The point here is to show that two numbers are sufficient to dictate the orientation of a plane. Referring to @fig-hold-book these are 1) the amount that one hand is raised relative to the other and 2) the angle of rotation around the hand-to-hand axis. 

Similarly, in the formula for a plane, the orientation is set by two numbers, $b$ and $c$ in $\text{plane}(x, y) \equiv a + b x + c y$.

How do we find the right $b$ and $c$ for the tangent facet to a function $g(x,y)$ at a specific input $(x_0, y_0)$? Taking slices of $g(x,y)$ provides the answer. In particular, these two slices:
$$\text{slice}_1(x) \equiv g(x, y_0) = a + b\, x + c\, y_0 \\ \text{slice}_2(y) \equiv g(x_0, y) = a + b x_0 + c\, y$$

Look carefully at the formulas for the slices. In $\text{slice}_1(x)$, the value of $y$ is being held constant at $y=y_0$. Similarly, in $\text{slice}_2(y)$ the value of $x$ is held constant at $x=x_0$.  

The parameters $b$ and $c$ can be read out from the derivatives of the respective slices: $b$ is equal to the derivative of the slice$_1$ function with respect to $x$ evaluated at $x=x_0$, while $c$ is the derivative of the slice$_2$ function with respect to $y$ evaluated at $y=y_0$. Or, in the more compact mathematical notation:

$$b = \partial_x \text{slice}_1(x)\left.\strut\right|_{x=x_0} \ \ \text{and}\ \ c=\partial_y \text{slice}_2(y)\left.\strut\right|_{y=y_0}$$
These derivatives of slice functions are called ***partial derivatives***. The word "partial" refers to examining just one input at a time. In the above formulas, the ${\large |}_{x=x_0}$ means to evaluate the derivative at $x=x_0$ and  ${\large |}_{y=y_0}$ means something similar. 

You need not create the slices explicitly to calculate the partial derivatives. 
Simply differentiate $g(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ to get parameter $b$ and differentiate $g(x, y)$ with respect to $y$ to get parameter $c$. To demonstrate, we will make use of the ***sum*** rule:
$$\partial_x g(x, y) = \underbrace{\partial_x a}_{=0} + \underbrace{\partial_x b x}_{=b} + \underbrace{\partial_x cy}_{=0} = b$$
Similarly, $$\partial_y g(x, y) = \underbrace{\partial_y a}_{=0} + \underbrace{\partial_y b x}_{=0} + \underbrace{\partial_y cy}_{=c} = c$$

::: {.callout-tip}
Get in the habit of noticing the subscript on the differentiation symbol $\partial$. When taking, for instance, $\partial_y f(x,y,z, \ldots)$, all inputs other than $y$ are to be ***held constant***. Some examples: 

$$\partial_y 3 x^2 = 0\ \ \text{but}\ \ \ 
\partial_x 3 x^2 = 6x\\
\ \\
\partial_y 2 x^2 y = 2x^2\ \ \text{but}\ \ \
\partial_x 2 x^2 y = 4 x y
$$

## All other things being equal

Recall that the derivative of a function with one input, say, $\partial_x f(x)$ tells you, at each possible value of the input $x$, how much the output will change proportional to a small change in the value of the input. 

Now that we are in the domain of multiple inputs, writing $h$ to stand for "a small change" is not entirely adequate. Instead, we will write $dx$ for a small change in the $x$ input and $dy$ for a small change in the $y$ input.

With this notation, we write the first-order polynomial approximation to a function of a single input $x$ as $$f(x+dx) = f(x) + \partial_x f(x) \times dx$$
Applying this notation to functions of two inputs, we have:
$$g(x + {\color{magenta}{dx}}, y) = g(x,y) + {\color{magenta}{\partial_x}} g(x,y) \times {\color{magenta}{dx}}$$ and $$g(x, y+{\color{brown}{dy}}) = g(x,y) + {\color{brown}{\partial_y}} g(x,y) \times {\color{brown}{dy}}$$

Each of these statements is about *changing one input* while *holding the other input(s) constant*. Or, as the more familiar expression goes, "The effect of changing one input  **all other things being equal** or **all other things held constant**. (The Latin phrase for this is *ceteris paribus*, often used in economics.)


Everything we've said about differentiation rules applies not just to functions of one input, $f(x)$, but to functions with two or more inputs, $g(x,y)$, $h(x,y,z)$ and so on.  


## Gradient vector {#sec-gradient-vector}

For functions of two inputs, there are two partial derivatives. For functions of three inputs, there are three partial derivatives. We can, of course, collect the partial derivatives into Cartesian coordinate form. This collection is called the ***gradient vector***. 

Just as our notation for differences ($\cal D$) and derivatives ($\partial$) involves unusual typography on the letter "D," the notation for the gradient involves such unusual typography although this time on $\Delta$, the Greek version of "D." For the gradient symbol, turn $\Delta$ on its head: $\nabla$. That is,
$$\nabla g(x,y) \equiv \left(\stackrel\strut\strut\partial_x g(x,y), \ \ \partial_y g(x,y)\right)$$

Note that $\nabla g(x,y)$ is a function of both $x$ and $y$, so in general the gradient vector differs from place to place in the function's domain.

The graphics convention for drawing a gradient vector for a particular input, that is, $\nabla g(x_0, y_0)$, puts an arrow with its root at $(x_0, y_0)$, pointing in direction $\nabla g(x_0, y_0)$, as in @fig-one-grad-arrow. 

::: {#fig-one-grad-arrow}

```

The gradient vector $\nabla g(x=1,y=2)$. The vector points in the steepest uphill direction. Consequently, it is perpendicular to the contour passing through its root.
:::

A ***gradient field*** (see @fig-gradient-field-A) is the value of the gradient vector at each point in the function's domain. Graphically, to prevent over-crowding, the vectors are drawn at discrete points. The lengths of the drawn vectors are set proportional to the numerical length of $\nabla g(x, y)$, so a short vector means the surface is relatively level, a long vector means the surface is relatively steep.
