In @sec-evanescent-h we used the rules associated with evanescent $h$, that is, $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$, to confirm our claims about the derivatives of many of the pattern-book functions. We will call these rules ***h-theory*** for short. This chapter will use h-theory to find algebraic ***rules*** to calculate the derivatives of linear combinations of functions, products of functions, and composition of functions. Remarkably, we can figure out these rules without specifying which functions are being combined. So the rules can be written in terms of abstractions: $f()$, $g()$, and $h()$. Later, we will apply those rules to specific functions, to show how the rules are used in practical work.

## Using the rules {#sec-using-the-rules}

When you encounter a function that you want to differentiate, you first have to examine the function to decide which rule you want to apply. In the following, we will to use the names $f()$ and $g()$, but in practice the functions will often be basic modeling functions, for instance $e^{kx}$ or $\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P}t\right)$, etc. 

***Step 1***: Identify f() and g() 

We will write the rules in terms of two function names, $f()$ and $g()$, which can stand for any functions whatsoever. It is rare to see the product or the composition written explicitly as $f(x)g(x)$ of $f(g(x))$. Instead, you are given something like $e^x \ln(x)$. The first step in differentiating the product or composition is to identify what are $f()$ and $g()$ individually.  

In general, $f()$ and $g()$ might be complicated functions, themselves involving linear combinations, products, and composition. But to get started, we will practice with cases where they are simple, pattern-book functions. 



***Step 2***: Find f'() and g'() 

For differentiating either products or compositions, you will need to identify both $f()$ and $g()$ (the first step) and then compute the derivatives $\partial_x f()$ and $\partial_x g()$. That is, you will write down four functions. 


***Step 3***: Apply the relevant rule

Recall from @sec-fun-assembling that will will be working with three important forms for creating new functions out of existing functions:

1. Linear combinations, e.g. $a f(x) + bg(x)$
2. Products of functions, e.g. $f(x) g(x)$
3. Compositions of functions, e.g. $f\left(g(x)\right)$



## Differentiating linear combinations

***Linear combination*** is one of the ways in which we make new functions from existing functions. As you recall, linear combination involves ***scaling*** functions and then ***adding*** the scaled functions as in $a f(x) + b g(x)$, alinear combination of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. We can easily use $h$ to show what is the result of differentiating a linear combination of functions.  First, let's figure out what is $\partial_x\, a f(x)$, Going back to writing $\partial_x$ in terms of a slope function:
$$\partial_x\, a\,f(x) = \frac{a\, f(x + h) - a\,f(x)}{h}\\
\ \\
= a \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = a\, \partial_x f(x)$$
In other words, if we know the derivative $\partial_x\, f(x)$, we can easily find the derivative of $a\, f()$. Notice that even though $h$ was used in the derivation, it appears nowhere in the result $\partial_x\, b\,f(x) = b\, \partial_x\, f(x)$. The $h$ is solvent to get the paint on the wall and evaporates once its job is done.

Now consider the derivative of the sum of two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_x\, \left[f(x) + g(x)\right] & =\frac{\left[f(x + h) + g(x + h)\right] - \left[f(x) + g(x)\right]}{h} \\
\ \\
&= \frac{\left[f(x+h) -f(x)\right] + \left[g(x+h) - g(x)\right]}{h}\\
\ \\
&= \frac{\left[f(x+h) -f(x)\right]}{h} + \frac{\left[g(x+h) - g(x)\right]}{h}\\
\ \\
&= \partial_x\, f(x) + \partial_x\, g(x)
\end{eqnarray}



Because of how $\partial_x$ can be "passed through" a linear combination, mathematicians say that differentiation is a ***linear operator***. Consider this new fact about differentiation as a down payment on what will eventually become a complete theory telling us how to differentiate a ***product of two functions*** or the ***composition of two functions***. We will lay out the $h$-theory based algebra of this in the next two sections.  

We can summarize the h-theory result for linear combinations this way:

> *The derivative of a linear combination is the linear combination of the derivatives.* 

That is:

$$\partial_x \left[\strut \color{magenta}{a} \color{brown}{f(x)} + \color{magenta}{b} \color{brown}{g(x)}\right] = \color{magenta}{a} {\large\color{brown}{f'(x)}} + \color{magenta}{b} {\large\color{brown}{g'(x)}}$$
as well as 
$$\partial_x \left[\strut \color{magenta}{a}\, \color{brown}{f(x)} + \color{magenta}{b}\, \color{brown}{g(x)}  + \color{magenta}{c}\, \color{brown}{h(x)} + \cdots\right] = \color{magenta}{a}\, {\large\color{brown}{f'(x)}} + \color{magenta}{b}\, {\large\color{brown}{g'(x)}} + \color{magenta}{c}\, {\large\color{brown}{h'(x)}} + \cdots$$


::: {.example data-latex=""}
The derivative of a polynomial is a polynomial of a lower order. 

Consider the polynomial $$h(x) = \color{magenta}{a}\color{brown}{x^0}  + \color{magenta}{b} \color{brown}{x^1} + \color{magenta}{c} \color{brown}{x^2}$$ The derivative is 
$$\partial_x h(x) = \color{brown}{0}\, \color{magenta}{a}  + \color{brown}{1}\, \color{magenta}{b}  + \color{magenta}{c}\, \color{brown}{2 x} = \color{magenta}{b} +  \color{magenta}{2 c}\  x$$

## Product rule for multiplied functions

The question at hand is how to compute the derivative $\partial_x f(x) g(x)$.  Of course, you can always use numerical differentiation. But let's look at the problem from the point of view of symbolic differentiation. And since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are just pronoun functions, we will assume you are starting out already knowing  the derivatives $\partial_x f(x)$ and $\partial_x g(x)$.

This situation arises particularly when $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are pattern-book functions for which you already have memorized $\partial_x f(x)$ and $\partial_x g(x)$ or are basic modeling functions whose derivatives you will memorize in Section \@ref(basic-derivs).

The purpose of this section is to **derive** the formula for $\partial_x f(x) g(x)$ in terms of $f(x)$, $g(x)$, $\partial_x f(x)$ and $\partial_x g(x)$. This formula is called the ***product rule***. The point of showing a derivation of the product rule is to let you see how the logic of evanescent $h$ plays a role. In practice, everyone simply memorizes the rule, which has a beautiful, symmetric form:

$$\text{Product rule:}\ \ \ \ \partial_x \left[\strut f(x)g(x)\right] = \left[\strut \partial_x f(x)\right]\, g(x) + f(x)\, \left[\strut\partial_x g(x)\right]$$ and is even prettier in Lagrange notation (where $\partial_x f(x)$ is written $f'$): $$ \left[\strut f g\right]' = f' g + g' f$$

As with all derivatives, the product rule is based on the instantaneous rate of change $$F'(x) \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h}$$ introduced in @sec-instantaneous-rate-of-change.

We also need two other statements about $h$ and functions:

1. The derivative $F'(x)$ is the slope of of $F()$ at input $x$. Taking a step of size $h$ from $x$ will induce a change of output of $h F'(x)$, so $$F(x+h) = f(x) + h F'(x)\ .$$
2. Any result of the form $h F(x)$, where $F(x)$ is finite, gives 0. More precisely, $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} h F(x) = 0$

As before, we will put the standard $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ disclaimer against dividing by $h$ until there are no such divisions at all, at which point we can safely use the equality $h = 0$. 

Suppose the function $F(x) \equiv f(x) g(x)$, a product of the two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.

$$F'(x) = \partial_x \left[\strut f(x) g(x) \right] \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h) g(x+h) - f(x) g(x)}{h}$$
We will replace $g(x_h)$ with its equivalent $g(x) + h g'(x)$ giving

$$= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) \left[\strut g(x) + h g'(x) \right] - f(x) g(x)}{h} $$
$g(x)$ appears in both terms in the numerator, once multiplied by $f(x+h)$ and once by $f(x)$. Collecting those terms give:

$$=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\left[\strut f(x+ h) - f(x)\right]  g(x) + \left[\strut f(x+h) h\, g'(x)\right]}{h}$$
This has two bracketed terms added together over a common denominator. Let's split them into separate terms:

$$=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\underbrace{\left[\strut \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\right]}_{f'(x)} g(x) + \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\left[\strut f(x) + h f'(x)\right]h\,g'(x)}{h}$$

The first term is $g(x)$ multiplied by  the familiar form for the derivative of $f(x)$ 
$$= f'(x) g(x) + \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x) h g'(x)}{h} + \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{h f'(x) h g'(x)}{h}$$
In each of the last two terms there is an $h/h$ involved. This is safely set to 1, since the $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ implies that $h$ will not be exactly zero. There remain no divisions by $h$ so we can drop the $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ in favor of $h=0$:
$$= f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x) + \cancel{h f'(x) g'(x)}$$

$$=f'(x) g(x) + g'(x) f(x)$$

The last step relies on statement (2) above.

Some people find it easier to read the rule in Lagrange shorthand, where $f$ and $g$ stand for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ respectivly, and $f'$ ("f-prime") and $g'$ ("g-prime") stand for $\partial f()$ and $\partial g()$. 

$$\large\text{Lagrange shorthand:}\ \   \partial[\color{magenta}f \times \color{brown}g] = [\color{magenta}f \times \color{brown}g]' = \color{magenta}{f'}\color{brown}g + \color{brown}{g'}\color{magenta}f$$

::: {.example data-latex=""}
The expression  $\partial_x x^3$ is the same as $\partial_x \left[\strut x\  x^2\right]$. Since we already know $\partial_x x$ (it is 1) and $\partial_x x^2$ (it is $2x$) let's apply the product rule to find $\partial_x x^3$:
$$\large\partial [\color{magenta}x \times \color{brown}{x^2}] = \color{magenta}{[\partial x]} \times \color{brown}{x^2} \ +\  \color{brown}{[\partial x^2]} \times \color{magenta}x =\color{magenta}1\times \color{brown}{x^2} + \color{brown}{2x} \times \color{magenta}x = 3 x^2$$

::: {.takenote data-latex=""}
Occasionally, mathematics gives us a situation where being more general produces simplicity.

In the case of function products, the generalization is from  products of two functions $f(x)\cdot g(x)$ to products of more than two functions, e.g. $u(x) \cdot v(x) \cdot w(x)$. 

The chain rule here takes a form that makes the overall structure much clearer:

\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_x \left[\strut u(x) \cdot v(x) \cdot w(x)\right] = \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\
\color{blue}{\partial_x u(x)} \cdot v(x) \cdot w(x)\ + \\ 
u(x) \cdot \color{blue}{\partial_x v(x)} \cdot w(x)\ + \\
u(x) \cdot v(x) \cdot \color{blue}{\partial_x w(x)}\ \  \ \ 
\end{eqnarray}

In the Lagrange shorthand, the pattern is even more evident:
$$\left[ u\cdot v\cdot w\right]' = \color{blue}{u'}\cdot v\cdot w\ +\ u\cdot \color{blue}{v'}\cdot w\ +\ u\cdot v\cdot \color{blue}{w}'$$

## Chain rule for function composition

A function composition, as described in @sec-function-composition, involves inserting the output of one function (the "interior function") as the input of the other function (the "exterior function"). As we so often do, we will be using pronouns a lot. A list might help keep things straight:

- There are two functions involved in a composition. Generically, we call them $f(y)$ and $g(x)$. In the composition $f(g(x))$, the ***exterior function*** is $f()$ and the ***interior function*** is $g()$.
- Each of the two functions $f()$ and $g()$ has an input.
In our examples, we use $y$ to stand for the input to the exterior function and $x$ for the input to the interior function.
- As with all rules for differentiation, we will need to compute the derivatives of the functions involved, each with respect to its own input. So these will be $\partial_y f(y)$ and $\partial_x g(x)$.

A reason to use different pronouns for the inputs to $f()$ and $g()$ is to remind us that the output $g(x)$ is in general not the same kind of quantity as the input $x$. In a function composition, the $f()$ function will take the output $g(x)$ as input. But since $g(x)$ is not necessarily the same kind of thing as $x$, why would we want to use the same name for the input to $f()$ as we use for the input to $g()$.

With this distinction between the names of the inputs, we can be even more explicit about the composition, writing $f(y=g(x))$ instead of $f(g(x))$. Had we used the pronound $x$ for the input to $f()$ but our explicit statement, although technically correct, would be confusing: $f(x = g(x))$!

With all these pronouns in mind, here is the ***chain rule*** for the derivative $\partial_x f(g(x))$:

$$\large\partial_x \left[\strut \color{magenta}{f\left(\strut\right.}\strut \color{brown}{g(x)}\color{magenta}{\left.\right)}\right] = [\color{magenta}{\partial_y f}](\color{brown}{g(x)}) \times [\color{brown}{\partial_xg(x)}]$$
Or, using the Lagrange prime notation, where $'$ stands for the derivative of a function with respect to its input, we have 
$$\large\text{Lagrange shorthand:}\ \   [\color{magenta}f(\color{brown}g)]' = \color{magenta}{f'} (\color{brown}g) \times \color{brown}{g}'$$

## Rates per time

In news and policy discussions, you will often hear about "inflation rate" or "birth rate" or "interest rate" or "investment rate of return."  In each case, there is a function of time combined with a derivative of that function: with the general form $$\frac{\partial_t f(t)}{f(t)}\ .$$ 

- Inflation rate: The function is cost_of_living($t$). The derivative is the rate of change with respect to time in the cost of living: $\partial_t\,$cost_of_living($t$).
- Birth rate: The function is population($t$). The derivative is $\partial_t\,$population($t$), or at least that component of the overall $\partial_t\,$population($t$) that is related to births. (Other components are deaths and the balance of in-migration and out-migration.)
- Interest rate: The function is account_balance($t$) and the derivative is $\partial_t\,$account_balance($t$).
- Investment returns: The function is net_worth($t$) and the derivative is $\partial_t\,$net_worth($t$).

In all these cases, The "rate" is not merely "per time" as would be the case for $\partial_t f(t)$. Instead the rate is "per unit of the *whole* per time." For birth rate, the "whole" is the population. The birth rate is the number of births in a year *divided by* the population itself. Birth rates are often stated with the phrase is "***per capita*** per year."["Per capita" is Latin. It translates to "by head." Its modern sense is "per unit of population." Of course, the "unit of population" is a person.]{.aside} 

Notice the two uses of "**per**" in the phrase: "births **per** capita **per** year." A proportional rate is two rates in one. Births per capita is a proportion of the population. Births per year is an average rate with respect to time. But "births **per** capita **per** year" is a rate in the proportion with respect to time. 

The rate word "**per**" also appears as part of "**percent**," which literally means "per hundred." A "percentage change" is the amount of change divided by the base amount. Confusingly, perhaps, "percentage change" is often truncated to the shorter "percent." This is the case with inflation rates, interest rates, and rates of return on investment. The interest rate on a credit-card debt is stated as a proportion of the current debt; all that is packed into the word "percent." The interest rate itself is the "proportion of the current debt **per** year": two rates in one.

Similarly for an inflation rate. "Inflation" is stated as the change in prices divided by the current price: a proportional change. "Inflation rate" is the proportional change **per** unit of time, where the "whole" is current prices and the rate is *change* in current prices per year divided by current prices.

Thanks to the chain rule, there is a shortcut way of writing proportional rates per time. Exactly equivalent to the ratio $\frac{\partial_t f(t)}{f(t)}$ is $$\partial_t \ln(f(t))\ .$$

Derivatives of logarithms appear often in fields such as economics or finance, where it is common to consider the logarithm of the economic quantity to render changes as percent of the whole.

## Math in the World: Linear or logarithmic axes?

It always pays to look carefully at the axes in a graph. For instance, consider @fig-italy-us-covid which shows the cumulative number of COVID during a period in 2020, early in the pandemic.  
 

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-italy-us-covid
#| fig-cap: "Growth in the number of Coronavirus cases in Italy and the US early in the pandemic. [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-data-logarithm-chart.html)"
knitr::include_graphics("www/NYT-italy-us-corona.png")
```

The two panels in @fig-italy-us-covid show the same data about growing numbers of coronavirus cases, the left graph on linear axes, the right on the now-familiar semi-log axes.

Most people are excellent at comparing slopes, even if they find it difficult or tedious to quantify a slope with a number and units. For instance, a glance suffices to show that in the left graph, well through mid-March the red curve (Italy) is steeper on any given date than the blue curve (US). Correspondingly, the number of people with coronavirus was growing faster (per day) in Italy.

The right graph tells a different story: up until about March 1, the Italian cases were increasing faster than the US cases. Afterwards, the US sees a larger growth rate than Italy until, around March 19, the US growth rate is substantially larger than the Italy growth rate.

The previous two paragraphs and their corresponding graphs seem to contradict one another. But they are both accurate, truthful depictions of the same events. What's different between the two graphs is that the left shows one kind of rate and the right shows another kind of rate. In the left, the slope is new-cases-per-day, the output of the derivative function

**left graph**: $\ \ \ \  \partial\_t\, \text{daily\_new\_cases}(t)$.

On the right, the slope is the ***proportional increase*** in cases per day, that is, 

**right graph**: $\ \ \ \ \frac{\partial_t\, \text{daily\_new\_cases}(t)}{\text{daily\_new\_cases}(t)}$.

From the chain rule, we know that

$$\partial_t \left[\strut\ln(f(t))\right] = \frac{\partial_t f(t)}{f(t)}\ .$$

Since the right graph is on semi-log axes, the slope we perceive visually is $\partial_t \left[\strut\ln(f(t))\right]$. That is an obscure-looking bunch of notation until the chain rule reveals it to be the rate of change at time $t$ divided by the value at time $t$.
:::



The derivation of the chain rule relies on two closely related statements which are expressions of the idea that near any value $x$ a function can be expressed as a linear approximation with the slope equal to the derivative of the function :

1. $g(x + h) = g(x) + h g'(x)$ 
2. $f(y + \epsilon) = f(y) + \epsilon f'(y)$, which is the same thing as (1) but uses $y$ as the argument name and $\epsilon$ to stand for the small quantity we usually write with an $h$. 

We will now look at $\partial_x f\left({\large\strut} g(x)\right)$ by writing down the fundamental definition of the derivative. This, of course, involves the disclaimer $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ until we are sure that there is no division by $h$ involved. 

$$\partial_x \left[{\large\strut} f\left(\strut g(x)\right)\right]  \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\color{magenta}{f(g(x+h))} - f(g(x))}{h}$$

Let's examine closely the expression $\color{magenta}{f\left(\strut g(x+h)\right)}$. Applying rule (1) above turns it into $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} f\left(\strut g(x) + \color{blue}{h g'(x)}\right)$$
Now apply rule (2) but substituting in $g(x)$ for $y$ and $\color{blue}{h g'(x)}$ for $\epsilon$, giving  
$$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \color{magenta}{f\left(\strut g(x+h)\right)} = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \color{brown}{\left[{\large\strut} f\left(g(x)\right) + \color{blue}{h g'(x)}f'\left(g(x)\right)\right]}$$
We will substitute the $\color{blue}{blue}$ and $\color{brown}{brown}$ expression for the $\color{magenta}{magenta}$ expression in 
$$\partial_x f\left(\strut g(x)\right)  \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\color{magenta}{f(g(x+h))} - f(g(x))}{h}$$ giving 
$$\partial_x f\left(\strut g(x)\right)  \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\color{brown}{f\left(g(x)\right) + \color{blue}{h g'(x)}f'\left(g(x)\right)} - f\left(g(x)\right)}{h}$$
In the denominator, $f\left(g(x)\right)$ appears twice and cancels itself out. That leaves a single term with an $h$ in the numerator and an $h$ in the denominator. Those $h$'s cancel out, at the same time obviating the need for $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ and leaving us with the chain rule:
$$\partial_x f\left(\strut g(x)\right)  \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\color{brown}{ \color{blue}{h g'(x)} f'\left(g(x)\right)}}{h} = f'\left(g(x)\right)\ g'(x)$$





::: {.example data-latex=""}
Use the chain rule to find the derivative $\partial_x e^{2x}$.

Recognize that $g(x) \equiv 2x$ is the interior function in  $e^{2x}$ and $f(x) \equiv \exp(x)$ is the exterior function.  Thus $$\partial_x e^{2x} = f'(g(x)) g'(x) = \exp(g(x)) 2 = 2 e^{2x}\ .$$ Happily, this is the same result as we got from using the product rule to find $\partial_x e^{2x}$.

Recognizing $e^{2x}$ as $e^x \times e^x$, we can apply the ***product rule***. 
:::

::: {.example data-latex=""}
The chain rule can be used in a clever way to find a formula for $\partial_x \ln(x)$. 

We've already seen that the logarithm is the inverse function to the exponential, and *vice versa*. That is:
$$e^{\ln(y)} = y \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ln(e^y) = x$$
Since $\ln(e^y)$ is the same function as $y$, the derivative $\partial_y \ln(e^y) = \partial_y y = 1$. 

Let's differentiate the second form using the chain rule:
$$\partial_y \ln(e^y) = \left[\partial_y \ln\right](e^y)\, e^x = 1$$ giving $$\left[\partial_y \ln\right](e^y) = \frac{1}{e^y} = \recip(e^y)$$
Whatever the function $\partial_x \ln()$ might be, it takes its input and produces as output the reciprocal of that input. In other words:
$$\partial_x \ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}\ .$$
:::

::: {.example data-latex=""}
Knowing that $\partial_x \ln(x) = 1/x$ and the chain rule, we are in a position to demonstrate the ***power-law rule*** $\partial_x x^p = p\, x^{p-1}$. The key is to use the identity $e^{\ln(x)} = x$. 

$$\partial_x x^p = \partial_x \left[e^{\ln(x)}\right]^p$$
The rules of exponents allow us to recognize $$\left[e^{\ln(x)}\right]^p = e^{p \ln(x)}$$
Thus, $x^p$ can be seen as a composition of the exponential function onto the logarithm function. 

Applying the chain rule to this composition gives
$$\partial_x e^{p \ln(x)} = e^{p\ln(x)}\partial_x [p \ln(x)] =
e^{p\ln(x)} \frac{p}{x}\ .$$ Of course, we already know that $e^{p \ln(x)} = x^p$, so we have 
$$\partial_x x^p = x^p \frac{p}{x} = p x^{p-1}\ .$$

## Derivatives of the basic modeling functions {#sec-basic-derivs}

The basic modeling functions are the same as the pattern-book functions, but with bare $x$ replaced by $\line(x)$.  In other words, each of the basic modeling functions is a ***composition*** of the corresponding pattern-book function with $\line(x)$. Consequently, the derivatives of the basic modeling functions can be found using the chain rule. 

Suppose $f()$ is one of our pattern-book functions. Then $$\large\partial_x f(\color{magenta}{ax + b}) = \color{brown}{a} f'(\color{magenta}{ax + b})$$ where $\color{brown}{a}$ is the derivative with respect to $x$ of $\color{magenta}{ax + b}$.

Here are the steps for differentiating a basic modeling function $\color{brown}{f}(\color{magenta}{a x + b})$ where $f()$ is one of the pattern-book functions:

- Step 1: Identify the particular pattern-book function $\color{brown}{f}()$ and write down its derivative $\color{brown}{f'}$. For example, if $f()$ is $\sin()$, then $f'()$ is $\cos()$.
- Step 2: Find the derivative of the linear interior function. If the function is $\color{magenta}{ax + b}$, then the derivative is $\color{magenta}{a}$. If the interior function is $\frac{2\pi}{P}(t-t_0)$, the derivative is $\frac{2 \pi}{P}$.
- Step 3: Write down the original function $\large\color{brown}{f}(\color{magenta}{a x + b})$ but replace $\large\color{brown}{f}$ with $\large \color{brown}{f'}$ and pre-multiply by the derivative of the interior function. For instance, $$\partial_x f(\color{magenta}{ax + b}) = {\large \color{magenta}{a}}{\large f'}(\color{magenta}{ax + b})$$ Another example: $$\partial_t \color{brown}{\sin}\left(\color{magenta}{\frac{2 \pi}{P}(t-t_0)} \right) = {\large \color{magenta}{\frac{2 \pi}{P}}}\color{brown}{\large\cos}\left(\color{magenta}{\frac{2 \pi}{P}(t-t_0) }\right) $$


By convention, there are different ways of writing $\line(x)$ for the different pattern-book functions, for instance: 

Pattern-book function $\longrightarrow$ | Basic modeling
:--:|:--:
$\sin(x)\ \ \ \longrightarrow$ |$\sin\left(\strut2 \pi \left[x-x_0\right]/P\right)$
$\exp(x)\ \ \ \longrightarrow$ | $\exp(k x)$
$x^2 \ \ \ \longrightarrow$ | $\left[mx + b\right]^2$
$1/x \ \ \ \longrightarrow$ | $1/\left[mx + b\right]$
$\ln(x) \ \ \ \longrightarrow$ | $\ln(a x + b)$

The rule for the derivative of any basic modeling function $f(\line(x))$ is $$\partial_x f(\line(x)) = \partial_x \line(x) \times \partial_x f\left(\strut\line(x)\right)$$

To illustrate:

- $\partial_x e^{\color{magenta}{kx}} = {\large\color{magenta}{k}}\, e^{\color{magenta}{kx}}$ where $\line(x) = kx$.
- $\partial_x \sin(2\pi (x-x_0)/P) = \frac{2\pi}{P}  \sin(2\pi (x-x_0)/P)$ where $\line(x) = 2\pi (x-x_0)/P)$.
- $\partial_x (mx + b)^2 = m\, 2 (m x + b) = 2 m^2 x + m^2 b$ where $\line(x) = mx + b$.
- $\partial_x \text{reciprocal}(mx + b) = \partial_x \frac{1}{mx + b} = - \frac{m}{(mx + b)^2}$ where $\line(x) = mx + b$ and we use the fact that $\partial_x \text{reciprocal}(x) = - 1/x^2$
- $\partial_x \ln(a x + b) = a/(ax+b)$ 
- $\partial_x \pnorm(x, \text{mean}, \text{sd}) = dnorm(x, \text{mean}, \text{sd})$. 
- $\partial_x \dnorm(x, \text{mean}, \text{sd}) =  - \frac{x-m}{\text{sd}^2} \dnorm(x, \text{mean}, \text{sd})$

You will be using the derivatives of the basic modeling functions so often, that you should practice and practice until you can write the derivative at a glance.

There are many possible implementations of the general concept of bump functions and sigmoid functions. This book uses $\dnorm()$ for the bump and $\pnorm()$ for the sigmoid. 

The names $\dnorm$ and $\pnorm$ are worth remarking on. As we've said before, $\dnorm()$ is called the ***gaussian function*** in many fields of science and engineering. It is also a centrally important function in statistics, where it is called the ***normal function***. (that is  how important it is: it is just "normal.") You may also have heard the normal function described as a "bell-shaped curve." 

In statistical nomenclature, $\dnorm()$ is called the "normal probability density function (PDF)" and $\pnorm()$ is called the "normal cumulative density function (CDF)." that is  way too wordy for our purposes. For brevity, we have adopted the R name for those functions: `dnorm()` and `pnorm()`.

Owing to the origin of the names $\dnorm$ and $\pnorm$, we are writing the parameters of the functions---mean and sd---using the computer language notation. The pattern-book functions are just $\dnorm(x)$ and $\pnorm(x)$, without listing the parameters. But the basic modeling functions, with parameters, are written $\dnorm(x, \text{mean}, \text{sd})$ and $\dnorm(x, \text{mean}, \text{sd})$. This violates the convention that the basic modeling functions are the composition of the pattern-book functions with $\line(x)$. But $\dnorm()$ does not  work this way because, by convention, the amplitude of the peak of $\dnorm()$ changes with the input parameter sd. That is not true for any other basic modeling function.

Composition or product?

There is one family of functions for which function composition accomplishes same thing as multiplying functions: the power-law family.

Consider, for instance, the function $h(x) \equiv \left[3x\right]^4$. Let's let $g(x) \equiv 3x$ and $f(y) \equiv y^4$. With these definitions, $h(x) = f(g(x))$.

Recognizing that $\partial_y f(y) = 4 y^3$ and $\partial_x g(x) = 3$, the *chain rule* gives $$\partial_x h(x) = 
\underbrace{4 g(x)^3}_{f'(g(x))} \times \underbrace{3}_{g'(x)} = \underbrace{4 (3 x)^3}_{f'(g(x))} \times 3 = 4\cdot 3^4 \times x^3 = 324\ x^3$$
Another way to look at the same function is $g(x)$ multiplied by itself 3 times: $$h(x) = g(x)\cdot g(x) \cdot g(x) \cdot g(x)$$
This is a product of 4 terms. Applying the product rule gives
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_x h(x) &=& \color{blue}{g'(x)}\cdot g(x)\cdot g(x) \cdot g(x) +\\
&\ & g(x)\cdot \color{blue}{g(x)}'\cdot g(x) \cdot g(x) +\\
&\ & g(x)\cdot g(x)\cdot \color{blue}{g(x)'} \cdot g(x) +\\
&\ & g(x)\cdot g(x)\cdot g(x) \cdot \color{blue}{g'(x)}
\end{eqnarray}
Since multiplication is commutative, all four terms are the same, each being $3^4 x^3$. The sum of all four is therefore $4 \times 3^4 x^3 = 324 x^3$. 

These are two long-winded ways of getting to the result. For most people, differentiating power-law functions algebraically is simplified by using the ***rules of exponentiation*** rather than the product or chain rule. Here,
$$h(x) \equiv \left[3x\right]^4 = 3^4 x^4$$so $\partial_x h(x)$ is easily handled as a scalar ($3^4$) times a function $x^4$. Consequently, applying the rule for differentiating power laws, 
$$\partial_x h(x) = 3^4 \times \partial_x x^4 = 3^4 \times 4 x^3 = 324 x^3$$
As another example, take $h(x) \equiv \sqrt[4]{\strut x^3}$. This is, of course, the composition $f(g(x))$ where $f(y) \equiv y^{1/4}$ and $g(x) \equiv x^3$. Applying the chain rule to find $\partial_x h(x)$ will work (of course!), but is more work than applying the rules of exponentiation followed by a simple power-law differentiation.
$$h(x) = \sqrt[4]{\strut x^3} = x^{3/4}\ \ \text{so}\ \  \partial_x h(x) = \frac{3}{4} x^{(3/4 - 1)} = \frac{3}{4} x^{-1/4}$$

## Exponentials and logarithms (optional)
    
The ***natural logarithm*** function, $\ln(x)$, is one of our basic modeling functions. As you know, there are other logarithmic functions. The one most often used is the logarithm-base-10, written $\log_{10}(x)$ or `log10(x)`. Ten is an integer, and a nice number to use in arithmetic. So in practice, it is sensible to use $\log_{10}()$. (Indeed, $\log_{10}()$ is the  digit() function, introduced in @sec-magnitudes).

The "natural" in the "natural logarithm" means something different. 

The base of the natural logarithm is the number called ***Euler's constant*** and written $e$. As a celebrity number, $e$ is right up there with $\pi$ and $i$. Just as $\pi$ has a decimal expansion that is infinitely long---the familiar $\pi = 3.14159265358979...$---Euler's constant has an infinitely long decimal representation: $e = 2.71828182845905...$  

It is not obvious why $e = 2.71828182845905...$ should be called "natural" by mathematicians. The reasons are:

1. $\ln(x)$ is the inverse of $e^x$, which is special for being invariant under differentiation: $\partial_x e^x = e^x$.
2. The derivative $\partial_x \ln(x)$ which has a particularly simple form, namely, $1/x$.

Let's look at the log-base-10 and its computer-savvy cousin log-base-2. The very definition of logarithms means that both 10 and 2 can be written $$10 = e^{\ln(10)}\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ 2 = e^{\ln(2)}$$
This implies that the base-10 and base-2 exponential functions can be written in terms of Euler's constant $e$:

$$10^x = \left[\strut e^{\strut\ln(10)}\right]^x = e^{\ln(10)x} \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ 2^x = \left[\strut e^{\strut\ln(2)}\right]^x = e^{\ln(2) x}$$
Calculating $\partial_x 10^x$ or $\partial_x 2^x$ is a matter of applying the chain rule:

$$\partial_x [10^x] = \partial_x [e^{\ln(10)x}] = e^{\ln(10)x} \times \ln(10) \ =\  10^x \times 2.3026$$ 
and
$$\partial_x [2^x] = \partial_x [e^{\ln(2)x}] = e^{\ln(2)x} \times \ln(2) \ = \ 2^x \times 0.6931$$
Like $e^x$, the derivatives of $10^x$ and $2^x$ are proportional to themselves. For $e^x$ the constant of proportionality is 1, a very natural number indeed.
