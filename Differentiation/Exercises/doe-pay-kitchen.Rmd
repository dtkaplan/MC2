Recall the differentiation rules for three of the pattern-book functions as presented in Section \@ref(symbolic-differentiation): 

Function name | Formula | Formula for derivative| power-law exponent $p$
--------------|---------|-----------------------|---------------
Identity      | $x$     | $1$         | 1
Square        | $x^2$   | $2\, x$     | 2
Reciprocal    | $1/x$   | $-1/x^2$    | -1

All three of these pattern-book functions are members of the power-law family: $x^p$. They differ only in the value of $p$.

There is a differentiation rule for the power-law family generally. The next question offers several formulas for this rule, only one of which is correct. You can figure out which one by trying the pattern-book functions in the table above and seeing which formula gives the correct answer for the derivative.

```{r dpk9-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of these formulas gives the correct differentiation rule for the power-law family $x^p$?",
  "+$p x^{p-1}$+",
  "$(p-1) x^{p+1}$" = "If this were true, the derivative of $x^2$ would be $x^3$.",
  "$x^{p-1}$",
  "$(p-1) x^{p-1}$" = "If this were true, the derivative of the identity function ($p=1$) would be 0." 
)
```
