TURN THIS INTO AN EXERCISE.

1. Calculate the average rate of change over the various intervals.
2. Mark those times when the car's speed is faster than the average speed.
3. Mark the times when the car is standing still.
4. Mark the times when the car is moving in a direction opposite to the overall trend of the trip.

Imagine a graph of the position of a car along a road as in @fig-stop-and-go. Over the course of an hour, the car traveled about 25 miles. Thus, the ***average*** speed is 25 miles/hour: the *slope* of the tan line segment. Given the traffic, sometimes the car stopped (time C), sometimes crawling (time D), and sometimes much faster than average (time B).  

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-stop-and-go
#| fig-cap: "The position of an imaginary car over time (black curve). The average rate of change over various intervals is the slope of the straight-line segment connecting the start and end of the black curve in that interval."
f <- doodle_fun(~ t, seed=105, n=5)
raw <- function(t) 
        f(t) - t - 30*dnorm(t, 0, 3) + 60*dnorm(t,7,1)
speed <- function(t) {
    pmax(4*raw(20*(t-.5)), 0)
}
position <- antiD(speed(t) ~ t)
Pts <- tibble::tibble(
    t = c(0, 0.19, 0.4, 0.54, 0.65, 1),
    y = position(t) + 2,
    label=c("", "A", "B", "C", "D", "")
)
Intervals <- tibble::tribble(
    ~t0, ~ t1, ~color,
    0, 1, "orange3",
    .54, .65, "darkorange",
    .19, .4, "green",
    .4, .54, "magenta",
) %>%
    mutate(y0=position(t0), y1=position(t1))
slice_plot(position(t) ~ t, bounds(t = c(0, 1)), size=2) %>%
    gf_labs(y = "x(t): Position from start of trip (miles)",
            x = "Time since start (hours)") %>%
    gf_text(0 ~ t, data = Pts, label=~label, color="dodgerblue") %>%
    gf_segment(2 + y ~ t + t, data = Pts[-6,], color="dodgerblue") %>%
    gf_segment(y0 + y1 ~ t0 + t1, data = Intervals, color=~color, alpha=0.5, size=3) %>%
    gf_refine(scale_color_identity())
