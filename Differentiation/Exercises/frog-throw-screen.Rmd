With very high-order derivatives, it can be awkward to use a notation with repeated subscripts, like $\partial_{xxxxx} f(x)$. Another notation often encountered is $f^{(5)}$, where the integer in the superscript tells the order of the derivative. We'll use that notation in this problem.

For a function $f(x)$ and its derivatives $f^{(1)}(x)$, $f^{(2)}(x)$, ... the Taylor polynomial $p(x)$ centered on $x_0$ is

$$p(x) \equiv f(x_0) + \frac{f^{(1)}(x_0)}{1!} (x - x_0)^1 + 
\frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!} (x - x_0)^2 + \cdots$$

A Taylor polynomial, like all polynomials, is a linear combination of basic functions. 

```{r ctp1-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of these are the basic functions being linearly combined in a Taylor polynomial?",
  "$f(x), f^{(1)}(x), f^{(2)}(x), \\ldots$" = "You won't find any of these in the definition of $p(x)$ given above. You're confusing $x$ with $x_0$.",
  "$f(x_0), f^{(1)}(x_0), f^{(2)}(x_0), \\ldots$" = "These are not functions of $x$. They are numbers computed by evaluating a function at the center point $x_0$.", 
  "$f(x_0), \\frac{f^{(1)}(x_0)}{1!},  \\frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!}, \\ldots$" = "These are not functions of $x$. They are numbers computed by evaluating a function at the center point $x_0$.",
  "+$(x-x_0), (x - x_0)^2, \\ldots$+" = "These are the only places where the name $x$ appears in the Taylor formula."
)
```
