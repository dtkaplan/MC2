Consider the model presented in Section @sec-low-order-two about energy expenditure walking distance $d$ on a grade $g$: $$E(d,g) = (a_0 + a_1 g)d$$ where $d$ is the (horizontal equivalent) of the distance walked and $g$ is the grade of the slope (that is, rise over run). 

We want $E$ to be measured in Joules which has dimension M L$^2$ T$^{-2}$. Of course, the dimension of $d$ is L, that is $[d] = \text{L}$.


```{r rp6-2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What is the dimension of the parameter $a_0$?",
    "dimensionless",
    "$L/T^2$",
    "$T/L^2$",
    "$M/T^2$",
    "+$M L/T^2$+",
    "$M/L^2$",
    "$M/(L^2 T^2)$",
    "$M L^2 / T^2$",
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r rp6-3, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What is the dimension of $g$? (Hint: $g$ is the ratio of vertical to horizontal distance covered.)",
    "+dimensionless+",
    "$L/T^2$",
    "$T/L^2$",
    "$M/T^2$",
    "$M L/T^2$",
    "$M/L^2$",
    "$M/(L^2 T^2)$",
    "$M L^2 / T^2$",
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r rp6-4, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What is the dimension of the parameter $a_1$?",
    "dimensionless",
    "$L/T^2$",
    "$T/L^2$",
    "$M/T^2$",
    "+$M L/T^2$+",
    "$M/L^2$",
    "$M/(L^2 T^2)$",
    "$M L^2 / T^2$",
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
