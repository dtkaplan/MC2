Consider this function, defined piecewise:

<!-- print rendering problem -->
<!-- $$h(x) \equiv \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}0 & \text{for}\ x < 0\\x^2 &  \text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\ .$$
-->



```{r echo=FALSE}
#| out-width: "30%" 
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics(("www/camel-fun.png"))
```


1. Write the R command to create this function. (Hint: Remember `ifelse` from Section @sec-fun-piecewise.)

2. Using a `r sandbox_link()`, plot $h(x)$ over the domain $-1 \leq x \leq 1$, then sketch a copy of the graph on your paper.

3. Create the function $\partial_x h(x)$ by differentiating separately each piece of the piecewise function $h()$. Write down $\partial_x h(x)$ using mathematical notation similar to the definition of $h(x)$ given above.

4. Sketch a graph of $\partial_x h(x)$ over the domain $-1 \leq x \leq 1$. You're welcome to use a `r sandbox_link()`, but you may be able to figure out the shape of the graph yourself.

5. The shape of the function you sketched in (4) has a name, given in the text in Section \@ref(continuity). What is that name?

Now you will do much the same as in items (3), (4), and (5), but instead of the first derivative $\partial_x h(x)$, create, sketch, and name the second derivative $\partial_{xx} h(x)$.

6. Create and write down $\partial_{xx} h(x)$ in mathematical notation.

7. Sketch $\partial_{xx} h(x)$

8. Classify the smoothness of $h(x)$ using the following table:

Smoothness | Criterion
-----------|-----------
$C^0$      | $\partial_x h(x)$ is discontinuous
$C^1$      | $\partial_x h(x)$ is continuous
$C^2$      | $\partial_{xx} h(x)$ is continuous
$C^3$      | $\partial_{xxx} h(x)$ is continuous
$\vdots$   | and so on.
$C^\infty$ | All orders of derivative of $h(x)$ are continous.
