Using the gradient field depicted below, figure out the sign of the partial derivatives at the labeled points. We will use "neg" to refer to negative partial derivatives, "pos" to refer to positive partial derivatives, and "zero" to refer to partials that are so small that you cannot visually distinguish them from zero.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1114)
Points <- tibble(
  x = 2*round(runif(15, -2, 2)),
  y = 2*round(runif(15, -2, 2))
) |> 
  group_by(x, y) %>%
  filter(row_number() == 1) |> 
  head(6) 

Points$label = LETTERS[1:6]
g <- doodle_fun(~ x + y, seed = 9823252)
gradient_plot(g(x, y) ~ x + y, bounds(x=c(-4.5, 4.5), y=c(-4.5, 4.5)), n=20) %>%
  gf_text(y ~ x, label=~label, data = Points, color="magenta", inherit=FALSE)
```


```{r bid3-1, echo=FALSE}
