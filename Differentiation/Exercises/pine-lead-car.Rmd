Recall from Section@sec-monotonicity that a function is ***monotonically increasing*** on a given domain when the function's slope is positive everywhere in that domain. A ***monotonically decreasing*** function, similarly, has a negative slope everywhere in the domain. When the slope is zero, or positive in some places and negative in others, the function is neither monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Each of the following graphs shows the derivative of some function $f(x)$. (Note: the graph does not show $f(x)$ but rather the function $\partial_x f(x)$) For each graph, say whether the function $f()$ is monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, or neither. (Note that the horizontal scale is the same in every graph, but the vertical scale can be different from one scale to another.)
