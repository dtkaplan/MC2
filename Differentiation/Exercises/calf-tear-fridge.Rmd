Here's the Taylor polynomial expansion of $\sin(x)$ about a center $x_0$:
$$p(x) = 1/2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}/{2}}{2!} (x - x_0)^2 + \frac{1/2}{4!} (x - x_0)^4 + \cdots$$

```{r ctf5, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of these is the numerical value of $x_0$? (Hint: Remember that the coefficients involve the function and its derivatives evaluated at $x_0$ as described in Section \\@ref(high-order-approx).)",
  "+$\\pi/6$+",
  "$\\pi/3$",
  "$\\pi/2$",
  "$\\pi$", 
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
