1. Draw the graph of a function from your imagination over the domain $-5 \leq x \leq 5$. The function should be continuous everywhere **except** at $x = -2, 1, 3$.

2. Draw the graph of a second function from your imagination over the same domain as in (1). The second function should be continuous everywhere in domain: no discontinuities. It should also have a derivative everywhere **except** at $x = -2, 1, 3$.
