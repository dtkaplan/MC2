In this exercise, you're going to be looking at the shape of contour lines very close to a reference point. The graph shows which function we will  be examining. The contours are unlabeled, to avoid distracting you with  numbers; we are interested in *shapes*. Four different reference points are marked, with these coordinates

```{r echo=FALSE}
Points %>%
  dplyr::arrange(label) %>%
  dplyr::relocate(label, .before = x0) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```



```{r echo = FALSE}
contour_plot(g(x, y) ~ x + y,
           bounds(x = c(-5, 5), y=c(-5, 5)),
           skip = 30)  %>%
  gf_text(y0 ~ x0, data = Points, label = ~ label, color  = "orange3")

```

For each of the reference points A to D, your job is to zoom in on the region around that point. The graphing expression in the sandbox has been written in a way  that allows you to specify exactly the coordinates of the reference point, and the  size of the region around that reference point being plotted. The initial example in the sandbox is for reference point A and a region size of 0.5. The reference point will always be **exactly in the center of the plot**.

You  are to consider the sequence  of region sizes

$$\text{size}: 0.5,\ 0.1,\  0.05,\  0.01,\  0.005,\ 0.001,\ 0.0005,\  0.0001$$

Start at the largest size and try successively smaller sizes until you find a size where the shape  of  the contour lines  is simple and very  similar to the shape from the previous size. (Ignore the contour labels: just look at the shape.)
