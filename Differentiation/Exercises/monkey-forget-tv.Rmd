The formula for the function $\dnorm(x)$ is
$$\dnorm(x) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\left(\frac{x^2}{2}\right)\ .$$

**A.** Use the chain rule to find $\partial_x \dnorm(x)$.

**B.** Confirm from your answer to (1) that there is another formula for $\partial_x \dnorm(x)$, namely $$\partial_x \dnorm(x) = - x \dnorm(x)\ .$$

**C.** Use the product rule to find $\partial_{xx} \dnorm(x)$. 

<!--
Ans: 
$$- \dnorm(x) + x^2 \dnorm(x) = \dnorm(x) \left[{\large\strut}x^2 - 1\right]$$
-->

**D.** From your answer to (3), compute the 3rd derivative $\partial_{xxx} \dnorm(x)$:

<!--
Ans: $$2 x \dnorm(x) - x \left[{\large\strut}x^2 - 1\right] \dnorm(x) = \dnorm(x) \left[{\large\strut} (3 x - x^3)\right] \ .$$
-->

**E.** Let's generalize the pattern. Each of the previous derivatives has been a polynomial---let's call it $p_n(x)$ for the $n$th derivative---times $\dnorm(x)$. Knowing $p_n(x)$, we can easily find $p_{n+1}(x)$:
$$p_{n+1}(x) = -x p_n(x) + \partial_x p_n(x)$$
We know $p_1(x) = -x$ so $p_2(x) = x^2 - 1$. In turn, this tells us
$p_3(x) = 3x - x^3$. Find:

1. $p_4(x)$
2. $p_5(x)$
3. $p_6(x)$
