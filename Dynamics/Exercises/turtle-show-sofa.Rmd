@fig-diff-Euler-separation shows the difference between the symbolic solution to $\partial_t x = x (1-x)$ and the Euler solution. The figure shows that the Euler solution (with $dt=0.1$) has an approximation error that is  small. The worst case is when $t \approx 3$ at which point it is less than 1.5 parts per million. Another good way to quantify this is the decimal place at which the calculated solutions differ.


```{r}
Euler <- integrateODE(dx ~ x*(1-x), x=0.01, 
                      bounds(t=0:20, dt=0.1)
Symb_soln = makeFun(A*exp(t)/(1 + A*exp(t)) ~ t, A=1/99)
Symb_soln(3)
Euler$x(3)
```

The approximation error occurs in the seventh decimal point.

A. How large can $dt$ be to keep the approximation error in the fourth decimal place of the answer.

B. How large can $dt$ be to keep the approximation error in the second decimal place of the answer.
