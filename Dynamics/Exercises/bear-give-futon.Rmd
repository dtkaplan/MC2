@fig-linearized-pendulum shows a flow field of the pendulum system and three pairs of trajectories, one pair for each of three initial conditions. Each trajectory starts at $t=0$ and ends at $t=6$. 

A. Read the three different initial conditions from the graph.

B. The dark gray trajectories are for the original (nonlinear) pendulum system while the $\color{magenta}{\text{magenta}}$ trajectories are for the linearized dynamics. Describe in words the differences in the trajectories for the nonlinear and the linearized dynamics.

C. The flow field corresponds to either the nonlinear (gray) or linearized  ($\color{magenta}{\text{magenta}}$) dynamics. Which one is it?
