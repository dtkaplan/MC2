The exercise is based on the interactive applet shown below. Click on the image to open up the applet in another tab of your browser. Then arrange so that the applet's tab is side by side with this one. That way you can see the questions and figure out the answer at the same time. 

<a href="https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/142Z-Eigenflows/" target="_blank"><img src='www/eigenflow-app.png' width="50%"></a>

We will look at trajectories that go round and round: oscillating solutions to the linear dynamics around a fixed point.

In the applet, click on the left-hand graph to set the $a$ and $b$ values in the [ab10] matrix. Clicking on the right-hand graph will start a trajectory (shown in red) from the place where you click.

You can create an oscillatory flow by clicking anywhere in the blue parabolic region in the left-hand graph. Play around with clicking in different spots in the parabolic region. Set the number of time steps for the red trajectory until you can see at least two full revolutions around the origin.

```{r oscil1-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Click near (but not on) the fixed point. Which of these best describes the shape of the trajectory?",
  "+A tightly wound spiral+",
  "A loosely wound spiral",
  "A rectangular shape",
  "Alternating between heading toward the fixed point and heading away from it."
)
```

```{r oscil1-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
   "Leaving the a and b values the same as when you answered the previous question, start the trajectory about half-way from the fixed point. How does the new trajectory compare to the one from the previous problem?",
  "A more tightly wound spiral",
  "+A more loosely wound spiral+",
  "A spiral that goes the other way round",
  "A rectangular shape"
)
```


```{rr oscil1-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Find some $a$ and $b$ that causes the trajectory to go round in a closed loop. (You might not be able to get it to close it exactly, but try the best you can.) Vary $a$ leaving $b$ alone, and vice versa, so you can see how the existence of the closed loop depends on $a$ and $b$. Which of these best describes the requirement for a closed loop?",
  "b is close to zero",
  "+a is close to zero+",
  "both a and b are close to zero",
  "a is bigger than b",
)
```

```{rr oscil1-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Drawing on your experience from the previous question in vary ing $a$ and $b$, which of these best describes the requirement for a trajectory that spirals **out** from the origin?",
  "$a < 0$",
  "+$0 < a$+",
  "$b < 0$",
  "$0 < b$",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```


```{rr oscil1-5, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Drawing on your experience from the previous question in vary ing $a$ and $b$, which of these best describes the requirement for a trajectory that spirals **in** toward the origin?",
  "+$a < 0$+",
  "$0 < a$",
  "$b < 0$",
  "$0 < b$",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{rr oscil1-6, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Now you should be pretty good at navigating the a-b space to make differently-shaped round-and-round trajectories. Focus for the moment on whether the spirals head in to the fixed point (stable) or away from it (unstable). What is the relationship between the eigenvalues and whether the trajectory is stable or not?",
  "real part is negative for stable flow",
  "real part is positive for stable flow",
  "imaginary part is negative for stable flow",
  "imaginary part is positive for stable flow",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{rr oscil1-7, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Explore close to the edges of the parabolic zone in a-b space. What happens to the trajectories compared to when a-b is in the middle of the parabolic zone?",
  "the speed of rotation slows down",
  "the speed of rotation is unchanged",
  "the speed of rotation increases",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{rr oscil1-8, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Look at the eigenvalues when you move around the a-b space. What aspect of the eigenvalues corresponds to the speed of revolution?",
  "the magnitude of the imaginary part",
  "the magnitude of the real part",
  "whether the imaginary part is positive or negative",
  "whether the real part is positive or negative.",
random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
